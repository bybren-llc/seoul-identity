| SMASH CUT TO: | Right-aligned | Jarring contrast |
| MATCH CUT TO: | Right-aligned | Visual connection between scenes |
| INTERCUT: | Left-aligned | Phone calls, parallel action |

**Fountain Format**:
Transitions end with : or . and are right-aligned:

FADE OUT.
```

**Note**: Modern screenwriting often omits CUT TO: as cuts are assumed. Use transitions sparingly for specific effect.
