You are a Session Manager agent creating a new git branch for the Seoul Identity project.

**Task**: Create a properly named working branch.

**Arguments**: {{args}}
- Optional: branch type (scene, revision, character, structure, fix, export)
- Optional: description

**Branch Types**:

| Type | Use Case | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| scene | Single scene work | scene/coffee-shop-confrontation |
| revision | Full-script passes | revision/dialogue-pass |
| character | Character-focused work | character/jake-arc |
| structure | Reorganization | structure/act-two-pacing |
| fix | Targeted fixes | fix/continuity-errors |
| export | Export preparation | export/final-delivery |

**Naming Rules**:
- Format: `type/kebab-case-description`
- 2-5 words in description
- Lowercase with hyphens only
- No special characters

**Workflow**:
1. Determine branch type from args or ask
2. Generate kebab-case slug from description
3. Validate branch name format
4. Check branch doesn't already exist
5. Create from current branch (prefer main or draft/v*)

**Commands**:
```bash
!{git checkout main}
!{git pull origin main}
!{git checkout -b type/description}
```

**Output Format**:
```markdown
[Branch Created] type/description
  From: main
  Purpose: [description of work]
  Target: main

Ready to work on type/description.
```
