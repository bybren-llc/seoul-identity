# ACT ONE

## SEQUENCE 1 - TWO FACES

= Jake Cooper leads a double life in 1993 Seoul - beloved English teacher by day, CIA operative by night. We establish both identities before they begin to collide.

INT. KOREAN LANGUAGE SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

[[Scene 1: Opening Image - Warm afternoon light through windows, 1993 Seoul]]

A modest classroom. Posters of American landmarks line the walls. A chalkboard reads: "ENGLISH CONVERSATION - INTERMEDIATE."

JAKE COOPER, 23, American, stands at the front with easy confidence. Button-down shirt, sleeves rolled up. He looks more like a grad student than a spy.

Six KOREAN STUDENTS, ages ranging from teens to middle-aged, watch him attentively.

JAKE
(in perfect Korean)
Okay, everyone. Today we practice asking directions. But first--

He switches to English, gesturing dramatically.

JAKE (CONT'D)
Only English from now on. No Korean. Even if it hurts.

The students laugh nervously. An OLDER WOMAN, 50s, raises her hand.

OLDER WOMAN
(heavy accent)
Teacher... what if we don't know the word?

JAKE
Then you find another way. Use your hands. Draw a picture. Act it out.

He mimes being lost, spinning in circles, looking confused. More laughter.

JAKE (CONT'D)
In America, nobody cares if your grammar is perfect. They care if you try.

A TEENAGE BOY in the back looks skeptical.

TEENAGE BOY
You speak Korean very good. How long you study?

JAKE
(beat, then warm smile)
A long time. And I made many, many mistakes. Still do.

He moves to the chalkboard, writes: "EXCUSE ME, WHERE IS THE SUBWAY?"

JAKE (CONT'D)
Now. Everyone repeat after me...

INT. KOREAN LANGUAGE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - LATER

[[Scene 2: End of day, golden hour light through windows]]

Students file out. Jake stands at the classroom door, saying goodbye to each one.

JAKE
(to Older Woman)
Your pronunciation is getting much better, Mrs. Park.

She beams, bowing slightly. Jake returns it naturally.

The Teenage Boy hangs back. Approaches Jake hesitantly.

TEENAGE BOY
Teacher... why you come to Korea? Why not stay in America?

Jake's smile flickers - just for a moment. Then it's back.

JAKE
Sometimes the best opportunities are far from home.

The boy nods, not quite satisfied, and leaves.

Jake watches him go. His expression shifts - the warmth fading into something harder, more watchful. He checks his watch.

INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - EVENING

[[Scene 3: Small studio, careful organization beneath surface clutter]]

A different Jake. Same face, different energy.

He stands at a desk covered with papers, photographs, a MAP of Seoul with pins and thread connecting locations. A shortwave RADIO crackles with static in the corner.

Jake studies a photograph: a Korean man in a business suit, entering a building. He flips it over - handwritten notes in code.

His fingers tap the desk rhythmically. Nervous habit.

The radio crackles. Jake crosses to it, adjusts the dial.

VOICE (V.O.)
(through static, coded)
Songbird, confirm receipt. Package ready for collection.

Jake picks up the receiver.

JAKE
(flat, operational)
Songbird confirms. Location Charlie, 2300.

He clicks off. Stands motionless for a moment.

Then he crosses to a closet. Pushes aside teacher clothes to reveal: dark jacket, black jeans, running shoes. A small PISTOL in a hidden compartment.

He stares at the gun. Doesn't take it. Closes the closet.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(to himself, quietly)
Just a pickup. In and out.

He grabs the dark jacket. His teacher's smile is long gone.

EXT. SEOUL MARKET - NIGHT
