# ACT ONE

## SEQUENCE 1 - TWO FACES

= Jake Cooper leads a double life in 1993 Seoul - beloved English teacher by day, CIA operative by night. We establish both identities before they begin to collide.

INT. KOREAN LANGUAGE SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

[[Scene 1: Opening Image - Warm afternoon light through windows, 1993 Seoul]]

A modest classroom. Posters of American landmarks line the walls. A chalkboard reads: "ENGLISH CONVERSATION - INTERMEDIATE."

JAKE COOPER, 23, American, stands at the front with easy confidence. Button-down shirt, sleeves rolled up. He looks more like a grad student than a spy.

Six KOREAN STUDENTS, ages ranging from teens to middle-aged, watch him attentively.

JAKE
(in perfect Korean; subtitled)
자, 여러분. 오늘은 길 묻는 연습을 해볼 거예요. 그런데 먼저--
*Okay, everyone. Today we practice asking directions. But first--*

He switches to English, gesturing dramatically.

JAKE (CONT'D)
Only English from now on. No Korean. Even if it hurts.

The students laugh nervously. An OLDER WOMAN, 50s, raises her hand.

OLDER WOMAN
(heavy accent)
Teacher... what if we don't know the word?

JAKE
Then you find another way. Use your hands. Draw a picture. Act it out.

He mimes being lost, spinning in circles, looking confused. More laughter.

JAKE (CONT'D)
In America, nobody cares if your grammar is perfect. They care if you try.

A TEENAGE BOY in the back looks skeptical.

TEENAGE BOY
You speak Korean very good. How long you study?

JAKE
(beat, then warm smile)
A long time. And I made many, many mistakes. Still do.

He moves to the chalkboard, writes: "EXCUSE ME, WHERE IS THE SUBWAY?"

JAKE (CONT'D)
Now. Everyone repeat after me...

INT. KOREAN LANGUAGE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - LATER

[[Scene 2: End of day, golden hour light through windows]]

Students file out. Jake stands at the classroom door, saying goodbye to each one. Golden light slants through dusty windows, catching motes in the air.

JAKE
(to Older Woman)
Your pronunciation is getting much better, Mrs. Park.

MRS. PARK beams, bowing slightly. Jake returns it naturally.

MRS. PARK
(in Korean; subtitled)
선생님 덕분이에요. 다른 선생님들은... 인내심이 없어요.
*It's because of you, Teacher. The other teachers... they don't have patience.*

JAKE
(in Korean; subtitled)
다른 선생님들도 훌륭해요.
*The other teachers are good too.*

MRS. PARK
(switching to English, practicing)
No. You are... special. My grandson, he say your class is only class he like.

She gestures down the hall where the Teenage Boy lingers, pretending to study a poster of the Statue of Liberty.

MRS. PARK (CONT'D)
(quieter, sincere)
Director Choi say you bring more students this year than any teacher. Even Korean teachers.

Jake shifts, uncomfortable with the praise.

JAKE
I just try to make it fun, Mrs. Park.

MRS. PARK
(touching his arm)
You make us feel... not stupid. For not knowing.

She bows again, deeper this time, and walks toward the exit. Jake watches her go, something flickering behind his eyes.

The Teenage Boy has been listening. He approaches Jake now, hesitant but curious.

TEENAGE BOY
Teacher... why you come to Korea? Why not stay in America?

Jake's smile flickers - just for a moment. Then it's back.

JAKE
Sometimes the best opportunities are far from home.

TEENAGE BOY
(not satisfied)
But you could teach anywhere. Better places. More money.

JAKE
(beat, choosing words carefully)
Money isn't everything.

TEENAGE BOY
Then what is?

The question hangs between them. Jake studies the boy's face - earnest, probing. The kind of question that deserves a real answer.

JAKE
(quieter)
Purpose. Feeling like what you do matters.

TEENAGE BOY
And teaching English to ajummas... that matters?

JAKE
(small smile)
More than you know.

The boy considers this. Nods slowly, still not fully convinced.

TEENAGE BOY
(in Korean; subtitled)
선생님은 이상한 미국 사람이에요.
*You're a strange American, Teacher.*

He leaves. Jake watches him go.

His expression shifts - the warmth fading into something harder, more watchful. He checks his watch. The teacher is already disappearing.

INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - EVENING

[[Scene 3: Small studio, careful organization beneath surface clutter]]

A different Jake. Same face, different energy.

The apartment is small - a studio that barely fits a bed, a desk, a hot plate. Through thin walls, a Korean soap opera plays next door. Outside, the distant honk of traffic on Jongno.

Jake moves through his evening routine with practiced efficiency. First, the sweep.

He runs his fingers along the door frame. Checks the single hair he placed across the closet door that morning - still in place. Examines the dust pattern on his windowsill. Nothing disturbed.

He relaxes, fractionally.

At the desk: papers, photographs, a MAP of Seoul with pins and thread connecting locations. A shortwave RADIO crackles with static in the corner. A half-eaten bowl of instant ramyeon, cold now.

Jake studies a photograph: a Korean man in a business suit, entering a building. He flips it over - handwritten notes in code. Cross-references it with a second photo. A third.

His fingers tap the desk rhythmically. Nervous habit.

Through the window, Seoul at night. Neon signs flicker red and blue. A delivery motorcycle weaves through traffic below. Somewhere, a street vendor calls out the day's last offerings.

Jake pauses. Catches his reflection in the dark window glass.

JAKE
(to himself, quiet)
Two years.

He looks at the man in the glass. Button-down shirt. Tired eyes. Who is he looking at? The teacher from this afternoon? The operative from the photographs?

His gaze drifts to a single personal item on his desk - a postcard from Ohio. The Cleveland skyline. He hasn't written home in months. Hasn't called. His mother thinks he's teaching English, building a career. Half-true.

The radio crackles. Jake crosses to it, adjusts the dial. The moment of reflection is over.

VOICE (V.O.)
(through static, coded)
Songbird, confirm receipt. Package ready for collection.

Jake picks up the receiver. His voice changes - flatter, more precise.

JAKE
(flat, operational)
Songbird confirms. Location Charlie, 2300.

He clicks off. Stands motionless for a moment, hand still on the receiver.

The soap opera next door reaches a dramatic climax. A woman's voice, crying in Korean. Jake doesn't move.

Then he crosses to a closet. Pushes aside teacher clothes - the khakis, the button-downs, the comfortable shoes - to reveal: dark jacket, black jeans, running shoes. A small PISTOL in a hidden compartment.

He reaches for the gun. Stops.

His hand hovers there. The weapon is clean, oiled, ready. He hasn't fired it in six months. Hasn't needed to. He's a courier, not a soldier. That's what he tells himself.

He stares at the gun. Doesn't take it. Closes the closet.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(to himself, quietly)
Just a pickup. In and out.

He pulls on the dark jacket. Checks his reflection one more time - this time in a small mirror by the door. The teacher is gone. Someone else looks back.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(barely audible)
Who are you?

No answer. He wasn't expecting one.

He kills the lights. The apartment falls dark except for the glow of Seoul through the window - a city of ten million people, and Jake Cooper, whoever he is, alone among them.

He grabs his keys. His teacher's smile is long gone.

EXT. JAKE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

[[Scene 3A: Theme Echo - Seoul spreads below, Jake alone with questions]]

Later. The pickup is done.

Jake stands on the rooftop of his building, cigarette burning between his fingers. He doesn't smoke, usually. Tonight he needed something to do with his hands.

Seoul sprawls below - a sea of lights stretching to the horizon. Namsan Tower blinks red in the distance. Somewhere down there, ten million lives unfolding. Families eating dinner. Students studying. Lovers meeting in coffee shops.

And Jake, above it all, watching.

He takes a drag. Exhales slowly.

JAKE
(to himself)
Two years.

He looks at his hands. The same hands that helped Mrs. Park with her pronunciation today. The same hands that accepted a package from a stranger two hours ago. Photographs. Names. Intelligence he'll never see used.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(quiet)
Is any of this real?

The question floats into the night air. Below, a car horn. A distant siren.

Jake thinks about the teacher in the classroom - patient, warm, connected. That felt real. The way the students looked at him. The way Mrs. Park touched his arm.

Then he thinks about the operative - the sweep of the apartment, the coded messages, the hidden gun. That feels real too. The precision. The purpose.

Which one is the mask?

He flicks ash over the edge. Watches it disappear into the dark.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(barely audible)
Who do you want to be, Jake?

No answer. Just the hum of the city. The endless lights.

He finishes the cigarette. Crushes it under his heel.

Tomorrow, he'll teach English. He'll smile. He'll pretend.

But tonight, standing on this rooftop, Jake Cooper doesn't know what he's pretending to be - or what he's pretending not to be.

He heads for the stairwell. The city keeps breathing below.

INT. LOCAL BAR - ITAEWON DISTRICT - NIGHT

[[Scene 3B: Aaron Introduction - Smoky local joint, American expat territory]]

A narrow bar off the main strip. American servicemen, English teachers, Koreans seeking Western atmosphere.

Jake sits at the bar, nursing a Hite. Baseball cap pulled low.

The door opens. AARON MITCHELL, 32, enters. Heavyset, rumpled khakis, short-sleeve button-down straining. An accountant who got lost on his way to a TGI Friday's.

He spots Jake.

AARON
Jake! Hey!

Jake tenses. Forces relaxation.

JAKE
(neutral)
Aaron. Didn't expect you here.

AARON
(sliding onto the adjacent stool)
What are the odds, right?

He waves at the BARTENDER, an older Korean woman.

AARON (CONT'D)
(in mangled Korean)
소주 주세요.

BARTENDER
Soju. Yes, Aaron. Same as always.

AARON
(self-deprecating)
Four years. Four years, and I still order soju like a tourist asking for directions to the bathroom.

JAKE
Some things don't translate.

The bartender sets down Aaron's soju. He raises it.

AARON
To surviving another day in the ROK.

They drink.

AARON (CONT'D)
You look beat. Rough day at the English factory?

JAKE
Something like that.

AARON
Cultural attache life isn't exactly thrilling either. Stamped visas for six hours today.

He's performing self-deprecation like a routine. Jake watches, guarded.

AARON (CONT'D)
Can I ask you something? What made you come here? Most guys our age are chasing corner offices back home.

Jake takes a slow drink. The same question the Teenage Boy asked. Different context.

JAKE
I wanted to do something that mattered.

AARON
(nodding slowly)
Yeah. Yeah, I get that. Back home I was... you know those guys who peaked in high school? I didn't even peak. I just sort of... plateaued at invisible.

Jake almost smiles. Almost.

AARON (CONT'D)
(quieter, leaning in)
The thing about being far from home is... nobody here knows who you weren't. You get to be whoever shows up.

He fidgets with his glass. The gesture reads as nervous. Too nervous.

He pulls out a crumpled BUSINESS CARD. Slides it across the bar.

AARON (CONT'D)
Just... if you ever need someone who gets it. The displacement. The weird hours. The thing where you wake up and forget what country you're in.

Jake looks at the card. Aaron Mitchell. Cultural Affairs. U.S. Information Service.

JAKE
(taking it)
Thanks.

AARON
(standing, too casual)
Anyway. Early morning. You know how it is.

He drops some won on the bar. Too much. A tell.

AARON (CONT'D)
You remind me of someone, actually. Guy I knew back in college. Had this thing where he needed everything to mean something, you know? Couldn't just exist.

(beat, almost wistful)

He's doing well now. I think.

He extends his hand. Jake shakes it.

JAKE
Good night, Aaron.

Aaron heads for the door. Turns back with a wave. Gone.

Jake looks at the business card. Something registers as off - too eager, too quick to establish common ground.

Or maybe Jake's just paranoid. Maybe Aaron's exactly what he seems.

He finishes his beer. Leaves the card on the bar.

Then picks it up. Pockets it.

Old habits.

EXT. KOREAN LANGUAGE SCHOOL - DAY

[[Scene 4: THE CATALYST - Harsh morning light, tension building]]

Jake approaches the school. Something's wrong. TWO BLACK SEDANS parked at odd angles. A small crowd of STUDENTS gathered outside, murmuring.

MRS. PARK (the older woman from class) spots Jake. Rushes to him.

MRS. PARK
(panicked, in Korean; subtitled)
선생님! 안에 남자들이 - 최 선생님을 잡았어요!
*Teacher! Men inside - they have Mr. Choi!*

JAKE
(sharp)
What men? How many?

MRS. PARK
Three. Maybe four. They say school owes money.

Jake's jaw tightens. He scans the building. Calculating.

JAKE
Go home. All of you. Now.

He moves toward the entrance. Mrs. Park grabs his arm.

MRS. PARK
Teacher, no - they have guns!

Jake gently removes her hand. His eyes have changed - the teacher is gone.

JAKE
(quiet, flat)
I know.

INT. KOREAN LANGUAGE SCHOOL - MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 5: Dim interior, shafts of light through dirty windows]]

Jake enters quietly. Moves through the hallway with trained precision - back to wall, checking corners. Nothing like a teacher.

Voices from the director's office. Angry Korean. A man pleading.

Jake pauses outside the door. Listens.

THUG #1 (O.S.)
...last warning. The money, or we take something more valuable.

MR. CHOI (O.S.)
(desperate)
Please - I don't have it. Give me one more week--

The sound of a SLAP. Mr. Choi cries out.

Jake's hand moves to the door handle. Stops.

This isn't his fight. He should walk away. Call in a report. Stay in cover.

Another SLAP. A woman SCREAMS - a secretary, maybe.

Jake closes his eyes. Opens them. Decision made.

He pushes open the door.

INT. DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 6: Cramped office, four men, one weapon visible]]

MR. CHOI, 60s, school director, cowers behind his desk. Blood on his lip. His SECRETARY huddles in the corner.

THREE THUGS in cheap suits. THUG #1 holds a pistol loosely at his side. THUG #2 has brass knuckles. THUG #3 guards the door - which Jake just came through.

Everyone freezes.

JAKE
(calm, in Korean; subtitled)
화장실 찾고 있었어요. 문 잘못 들어왔네요.
*I'm looking for the restroom. Wrong door.*

He starts to back out. Thug #3 blocks him.

THUG #1
(sneering)
The American teacher. I heard about you.

JAKE
I'm nobody. I teach English. That's all.

Thug #1 steps closer. Studies Jake's face.

THUG #1
You teach English. But you move like a soldier.

Beat. Jake's mask slips - just for a second.

THUG #1 (CONT'D)
Who are you really?

JAKE
(flat)
Someone you should let walk away.

Thug #1 LAUGHS. Raises his pistol toward Jake.

What happens next takes three seconds.

Jake catches Thug #1's wrist, twists, strips the gun. Elbow to Thug #2's throat. Thug #3 rushes him - Jake sidesteps, uses momentum to slam him into the wall.

All three thugs down. Jake stands over them, breathing hard, holding the pistol professionally. Finger off trigger. Barrel down.

Mr. Choi stares, mouth open.

MR. CHOI
How did you--

JAKE
(cutting him off)
Call the police. Tell them it was a robbery. You fought them off.

MR. CHOI
But--

JAKE
(harder)
You fought them off. Understand?

Jake looks at the pistol in his hand. The thugs groaning on the floor. His cover - six months of careful work - evaporating.

He sets the gun on the desk. Starts for the door.

A SOUND in the hallway. Footsteps. Jake tenses.

AARON (O.S.)
(calling out, nervous)
Hello? Mr. Choi? I was passing by and heard--

Aaron Mitchell appears in the doorway. He freezes.

Takes in the scene: Three unconscious men. Mr. Choi bleeding behind his desk. The secretary sobbing. And Jake Cooper, standing in the middle of it all, looking nothing like an English teacher.

AARON (CONT'D)
(stunned)
Holy shit.

JAKE
(flat)
Aaron. What are you doing here?

AARON
I was - I came to deliver some cultural exchange materials. The door was open, I heard shouting...
(staring at the thugs)
Did you... did you do this?

Jake doesn't answer. The answer is obvious.

AARON (CONT'D)
(different voice now, assessing)
Three guys. Armed. In what, thirty seconds?

JAKE
You should leave. Now. The police are coming.

AARON
(not moving)
Where'd you learn to do that? That's not language school training.

Their eyes meet. A moment of mutual recognition - two men realizing the other is more than they seem.

Jake moves past Aaron toward the door.

JAKE
(low, for Aaron only)
Forget what you saw.

AARON
(equally low)
Jake. Wait.
(beat)
We should talk.

Jake pauses. Studies Aaron's face. The nervous accountant act has slipped, just slightly. Something sharper underneath.

JAKE
Not here.

AARON
The alley behind the building. Two minutes.

Jake considers. Then gives a single nod. He exits.

Aaron lingers for just a moment. His eyes sweep the room - cataloging, memorizing. Then he follows.

JAKE (V.O.)
(to himself)
Damn it.

EXT. KOREAN LANGUAGE SCHOOL - BACK ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

[[Scene 6A: Private debrief - Two Americans, masks slipping]]

Jake leans against a grimy wall, arms crossed. Waiting.

Aaron appears around the corner. He's wiping his palms on his khakis - the nervous habit. But his eyes are steady.

JAKE
(flat)
Talk.

AARON
(glancing around)
Not here. Let me buy you a coffee. Somewhere quiet.

JAKE
I don't have time for coffee.

AARON
Make time.
(beat, softer)
Look, Jake. I don't know what you are. Teacher, soldier, something else. But I know what I just saw. And I know what happens when the wrong people hear about it.

JAKE
Is that a threat?

AARON
(genuine surprise)
What? No. God, no.
(running hand through thinning hair)
I'm trying to help. We Americans gotta stick together out here, remember?

Jake studies him. The self-deprecating bumbler from the bar is still there, but now there's something else. Concern? Or calculation?

JAKE
Why would you help me?

AARON
Because...
(struggling for words)
Because I've been in Seoul four years. I know how this works. You piss off the wrong people, you disappear. No investigation, no questions. Just gone.

He steps closer. Lowers his voice.

AARON (CONT'D)
Those guys in there? They're not random thugs. The tattoos on their necks - that's organization. And they're going to want to know who put them down.

JAKE
(cold)
How do you know about the tattoos?

AARON
(slight smile)
I notice things. It's the one skill I actually have.
(beat)
Look. I'm nobody important. Desk jockey. Visa stamper. But I hear things through the embassy network. I can find out who those guys work for, maybe get ahead of whatever's coming.

Jake says nothing. Weighing.

AARON (CONT'D)
(earnest, or performing earnest)
I'm not asking for anything, Jake. I'm just offering. One American to another.

A long moment. Jake's instincts say trust no one. But Aaron saw everything. That makes him either an ally or a liability.

JAKE
(finally)
One coffee.

AARON
(relieved)
Great. There's a place in Myeongdong - quiet, no foreigners. I'll text you the address.
(pulling out his card again)
Oh wait, you already have my--

JAKE
I have it.

He pushes off the wall. Starts to leave. Then stops.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(not turning)
Aaron. If you're not what you seem...

AARON
(quickly)
I'm exactly what I seem. A mediocre bureaucrat who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.
(beat)
Or maybe the right place. We'll see.

Jake walks away without responding.

Aaron watches him go. His expression shifts - just for a moment. Something calculating behind the friendly eyes.

Then he's Aaron again, nervous and bumbling, hurrying toward the street before the police arrive.

EXT. KOREAN LANGUAGE SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

[[Scene 7: Jake exits front, Mr. Kim waiting - A choice is made]]

Jake emerges into bright daylight from the front entrance. Pauses. Scans the street.

Across the street, a BLACK SEDAN. Tinted windows. The same sedan that's been parked near his apartment building. Near the market. Near the drop points.

Jake doesn't run. Doesn't hide.

He makes a choice.

He walks toward it.

The rear window rolls down. MR. KIM, 50s, severe face, sits in the back seat. Cold eyes assess Jake.

MR. KIM
(in English, perfect diction)
That was impressive, Mr. Cooper. Reckless. But impressive.

JAKE
(stopping three feet from the car)
You've been following me. For weeks.

A statement, not a question.

MR. KIM
(slight nod)
Months, actually. You're observant. That's good.

JAKE
Who are you?

MR. KIM
Someone who appreciates talent. And discretion.

JAKE
That's not an answer.

MR. KIM
(cold smile)
No. It's an invitation.

He gestures to the empty seat beside him. Jake doesn't move.

JAKE
I'm not getting in that car until I know what this is.

MR. KIM
(studying him)
Direct. I like that.
(beat)
My name is Kim. I represent certain... interests. Interests that align with your own.

JAKE
My interests are teaching English.

MR. KIM
(amused)
Your interests are serving your country. Though I wonder if you've ever questioned which country you're actually serving.

Jake's jaw tightens. The observation lands.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
I'm not here to expose you, Mr. Cooper. Quite the opposite. I'm here to offer clarity.

JAKE
Clarity about what?

MR. KIM
About who you are. What you've been doing. And what you could become.

A POLICE SIREN in the distance. Getting closer. Mr. Kim glances toward the sound.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
We should continue this conversation elsewhere. The police will have questions about those men inside. Questions you don't want to answer.

JAKE
(not moving)
What's in it for you?

Mr. Kim considers the question. For a moment, the mask slips - something human beneath the cold exterior.

MR. KIM
Let's say I've invested considerable time observing you. I don't waste investments.

The siren grows louder. Jake looks back at the school. Mrs. Park is probably still in there, explaining to the police. Mr. Choi is probably lying about how the thugs were subdued.

His cover is already compromised. Staying here only makes it worse.

JAKE
(decision made)
Fine. But I have questions of my own.

MR. KIM
(pleased)
I would be disappointed if you didn't.

Jake opens the door. Pauses.

JAKE
If this is a trap, you should know - I'll make it expensive.

MR. KIM
(meeting his eyes)
I'm counting on it.

Jake gets in. The door closes.

INT. MR. KIM'S SEDAN (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 7A: Tinted windows, cityscape sliding past - Jake's first test]]

The car pulls smoothly into traffic. A DRIVER in front, silent, professional. Tinted partition raised.

Jake sits rigidly, maintaining distance from Mr. Kim. Eyes scanning the interior - noting exits, potential weapons, the driver's posture.

MR. KIM
(observing Jake's assessment)
You've been trained well. Better than most of your countrymen.

JAKE
How long have you been watching me?

MR. KIM
Since before you arrived in Seoul.

JAKE
(genuinely surprised)
That's not possible. I was vetted. Cleared. My assignment--

MR. KIM
(cutting him off)
Your assignment was approved because certain people wanted you here. People who saw your potential before you did.

Jake processes this. The implications are unsettling.

JAKE
What people?

MR. KIM
The same people who trained you. Who gave you your cover. Who send you on midnight pickups and coded broadcasts.
(beat)
Did you never wonder why a twenty-three-year-old with no military background was given such... sensitive work?

Silence. Jake has wondered. More than once.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
You were chosen, Mr. Cooper. Selected. Cultivated.

JAKE
By who?

Mr. Kim smiles. Doesn't answer directly.

MR. KIM
The world is more complicated than they told you at Langley. There are no clean sides. Only interests. Only survival.

JAKE
(hardening)
I know what side I'm on.

MR. KIM
Do you?
(leaning forward)
Tell me, Jake - may I call you Jake? - when did you last speak with your handler? Not the drops. Not the coded messages. An actual conversation.

Jake opens his mouth. Closes it.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
You've never met him. Never heard his voice without filters. For all you know, your instructions come from a machine. Or from someone you've never considered.

JAKE
What are you suggesting?

MR. KIM
(sitting back)
Nothing. Yet. I'm simply asking you to consider the possibility that your certainties are not as certain as you believe.

The car turns onto a broader avenue. Namsan Tower visible through the window.

JAKE
What do you want from me?

MR. KIM
Right now? Only this conversation. An opportunity to plant a seed.

JAKE
And later?

MR. KIM
Later, you may find yourself with questions. Questions your Agency cannot - or will not - answer. When that time comes, I would like you to remember this conversation.

He reaches into his jacket. Jake tenses.

Mr. Kim produces a BUSINESS CARD. Plain white. A phone number. Nothing else.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
When you're ready to ask the right questions.

Jake takes the card. Examines it.

JAKE
And the right questions are?

MR. KIM
(almost gentle)
Not "who am I working for."
(beat)
The right question is "who do I want to be."

The words land. Jake stares at him.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
(to driver)
Stop here.

The car pulls to the curb. They're in Myeongdong, crowded with shoppers. Anonymous.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
Think about what I've said, Mr. Cooper. And watch your back. Those men at the school - they have friends. Friends who will be curious about the American teacher who fights like a soldier.

JAKE
Is that a threat?

MR. KIM
(shaking his head)
An observation. I protect my investments.
(beat)
Consider yourself observed.

Jake opens the door. Steps out. Turns back.

JAKE
If I decide you're not what you seem--

MR. KIM
(cutting him off)
Then we'll have a very different conversation. But I suspect you already know I'm exactly what I seem.
(cold smile)
Someone who sees you clearly. Perhaps more clearly than you see yourself.

Jake stares at him for a long moment. Then closes the door.

The sedan pulls away. Jake stands on the crowded street, the business card still in his hand.

He looks at it. A phone number. A question he's not ready to ask.

He pockets the card.

Around him, Seoul flows past - ten million people with ten million identities. All certain of who they are.

Jake isn't certain of anything anymore.

EXT. SEOUL MARKET - NIGHT

[[Scene 8: Wide shot, low-key neon lighting - Aaron tail established]]

A bustling night market in Namdaemun. Neon signs flicker in red and gold. Vendors shout prices in rhythmic Korean. Steam rises from food stalls, carrying the smell of grilled meat, sesame, fermented cabbage.

1993 Seoul at full volume. Motorcycle delivery drivers weave between pedestrians. A busker plays accordion, badly. Ajummas haggle over vegetable prices with theatrical outrage.

Jake weaves through the chaos, slightly out of focus against the vivid backdrop. He moves with practiced tradecraft - never looking directly behind him, using reflections in shop windows, timing his pace to catch surveillance in his peripheral vision.

He pauses at a watch vendor. Examines a fake Rolex. Uses the display case mirror to scan the crowd behind him.

Nothing obvious. But Jake's instincts are buzzing.

Thirty meters back, AARON MITCHELL follows. Different Aaron now - no nervous energy, no self-deprecating hunch. He moves with the crowd naturally, stopping when Jake stops, using other shoppers as cover.

He wears a baseball cap pulled low. Blends with the other foreigners browsing the market. Nobody special. Just another American tourist.

Aaron watches Jake examine the watches. His eyes are calculating. Patient.

Jake moves on. Aaron waits a beat, then follows.

Jake stops at a TTEOKBOKKI VENDOR. An OLD WOMAN, 70s, stirs the bubbling red sauce. Her stall is positioned at the intersection of three alleys - good sightlines, multiple exits.

OLD WOMAN
(in Korean, not looking up; subtitled)
일찍 왔네. 떡볶이가 아직 덜 됐어.
*You're early. The rice cakes need more time.*

JAKE
(casual, ordering)
I'll wait.

He positions himself with his back to a wall. Watches the crowd while pretending to watch the cooking. An old habit. Stay alive long enough, you do it without thinking.

OLD WOMAN
(still stirring)
왜 이렇게 피곤해 보여? 잠을 못 잤어?
*Why you look so tired? Not sleeping?*

JAKE
(in Korean; subtitled)
요즘 고민이 많아요.
*A lot on my mind lately.*

OLD WOMAN
(snorting)
미국 사람들. 항상 고민이 많아. 한국 사람들은 그냥 일해.
*Americans. Always thinking too much. Koreans just work.*

She ladles tteokbokki into a paper cup. Hands it to him. Their fingers brush - a SMALL FOLDED PAPER passes between them. The exchange is seamless, invisible to anyone watching.

Jake takes a bite. The spice hits. He doesn't flinch.

JAKE
(eyes scanning the crowd)
맛있어요.
*Delicious.*

OLD WOMAN
(louder, for show)
Too much spice for American stomach, maybe.

JAKE
(taking another bite)
I've learned to handle the heat.

Across the market, Aaron has stopped at a leather goods stall. He's pretending to examine a wallet while watching Jake in the reflection of a mirror display.

The Old Woman's eyes flick to something behind Jake - not Aaron, someone else. A warning.

OLD WOMAN
(quieter, barely moving her lips)
Some heat you don't survive.

JAKE
(equally quiet)
How many?

OLD WOMAN
(in Korean; subtitled)
두 명. 옷이 안 맞아.
*Two. Clothes don't fit the market.*

Jake processes this. Two tails. Plus whatever he might have missed.

He pockets the paper. Drops won on the counter - more than necessary, the extra bills a coded message: *transmission received, will verify.*

JAKE
(normal voice)
Same time next week?

OLD WOMAN
(already serving another customer)
If you live that long.

Jake moves on without looking back. His pace unchanged, but his route shifts - now heading toward a crowded intersection where multiple alleys meet.

Behind him, the two men the Old Woman spotted have materialized from the crowd. Dark suits. Wrong shoes for a market. They're not trying to hide anymore.

Further back, Aaron watches it all unfold. He stops walking. Pulls out a small notebook. Writes something down. His lips move slightly, as if memorizing.

Then he peels off, taking a different route. He's seen enough.

Jake reaches the intersection. Three directions to choose from. The two suits are closing in. He could lose them easily in the market chaos.

Instead, he stops. Turns. Looks directly at them.

The suits freeze. They didn't expect him to make eye contact.

JAKE
(loud enough to carry)
Beautiful night for shopping.

He disappears into the crowd before they can respond.

The suits exchange a look. Then follow. But Jake is already gone, swallowed by the neon and the noise.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

[[Scene 9: Low-angle shot, moonlight with artificial light - Jake's calculation]]

Jake stands on the edge of a rooftop. Wind whips through his hair. Seoul spreads below - a sea of lights stretching toward the mountains.

He's calculating. Running probabilities.

The market. Two tails in suits - not his Agency, wrong style. Mr. Kim's people? Someone else? Then there was the American tail he almost missed. The one who moved like he'd been trained.

Aaron.

Jake shakes his head. Aaron is a paper-pusher. A visa stamper. Soft hands and bad Korean. But something about tonight bothers him. The timing. The coincidences.

His mind races through scenarios:

If Mr. Kim is who he says he is - South Korean intelligence, parallel operation - then the market tails could be his. Protective surveillance. Or test surveillance, checking Jake's tradecraft.

If Mr. Kim isn't who he says he is...

Jake doesn't finish the thought. Can't.

A SOUND from the stairwell. Jake doesn't turn around. He's positioned himself with the building's water tower at his back - no angle for a sniper, limited approach vectors.

An UNKNOWN MAN, 40s, hard face, emerges from the stairwell. Dressed in black. One hand inside his jacket.

Jake assesses without looking: Right hand in jacket - weapon or document. Weight on front foot - not aggressive, presenting. Breathing steady - not here to fight.

JAKE
You've been following me since Myeongdong. Either you're very bad at your job, or you wanted me to know.

UNKNOWN MAN
(thick Korean accent)
You're observant. For a teacher.

JAKE
(turning slowly, hands visible)
What do you want?

Jake runs the calculus: The man is alone. Mid-forties, military bearing - probably KCIA trained, pre-reform. The accent is Seoul but the cadence is Northern. Interesting.

UNKNOWN MAN
Information. Same as everyone in this city.

JAKE
I teach English. Verb conjugation. Proper use of articles.

UNKNOWN MAN
(stepping closer)
You teach lies. Same as us.

His hand moves inside his jacket. Jake tenses - not to flee, to respond. He's already identified three potential weapons within reach: a loose brick by the ventilation shaft, a length of pipe near the water tower, the man's own weapon if Jake can close the distance fast enough.

JAKE
If you were going to shoot me, you would have done it downstairs. Less wind. Cleaner shot. Plus you approached from the east stairwell - you want to be seen. You want me to hear what you have to say.

The Unknown Man's eyebrow rises. Reassessing.

UNKNOWN MAN
(new respect)
They trained you well.

JAKE
(flat)
Who's "they"?

The Unknown Man doesn't answer. He withdraws his hand - holding a BUSINESS CARD.

UNKNOWN MAN
Tomorrow. Noon. The address is on the back.

He extends it. Jake doesn't take it.

JAKE
And if I don't show?

UNKNOWN MAN
Then you'll never know who you're really working for.

Jake processes this. Third time today someone's questioned his certainties. First Mr. Kim. Then Aaron's too-convenient appearance at the school. Now this.

Pattern recognition kicks in. Either these events are connected - coordinated approach, multiple vectors - or Jake is experiencing a catastrophic operational failure.

Neither option is comforting.

JAKE
Everyone seems very interested in my employment situation today.

UNKNOWN MAN
(slight smile)
Then perhaps you should ask better questions about your employer.

He drops the card. It skitters across the rooftop. Stops at Jake's feet.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
Pleasant dreams, Mr. Cooper.

He backs toward the stairwell. Jake doesn't move. Doesn't look down at the card. He's tracking the man's hands, his posture, any sign of deception.

The Unknown Man disappears.

Beat. Jake waits. Counts to thirty. Only then does he move.

He picks up the card. Stares at it. A simple address. A time. No name.

JAKE
(to himself)
Who I'm really working for?

He thinks about his handler. The voice through the radio, always filtered, always anonymous. The drops. The packages. Two years of faithful service and he's never met anyone face to face. Never questioned why.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(quieter)
Who do you want to be?

Mr. Kim's question. Echoing.

Below, Seoul pulses with life. Ten million people living their lives. Knowing who they are. Certain of their identities.

Jake isn't certain of anything anymore. And that uncertainty might be the only honest thing about him.

He pockets the card. Heads for the stairwell.

Tomorrow, he'll meet whoever sent the Unknown Man. He'll get answers. Or he'll get more questions.

Either way, he's done being a passenger in his own life.

The door closes behind him. The rooftop is empty except for the wind.

## SEQUENCE 2 - THE CONTACT

= Jake meets Mr. Han and receives information that will change everything.

INT. SMALL CAFE - NIGHT

[[Scene 10: Two-shot from side, low warm lighting]]

A dimly lit corner table. Two cups of barley tea. Steam rising.

MR. HAN, Korean, 50s, sits with perfect stillness. His face is weathered, eyes sharp. He wears simple clothes but carries himself like someone who once wore uniforms.

Jake slides into the seat across from him. Suspicious. Coiled.

JAKE
You wanted to meet. I'm here.

MR. HAN says nothing. Sips his tea. Waits.

JAKE (CONT'D)
The man on the rooftop. He works for you?

MR. HAN
(finally, measured)
He works for himself. Same as everyone.

JAKE
Including you?

MR. HAN
I work for the truth. A poor employer. Terrible benefits.

He pushes a FOLDER across the table. Jake doesn't touch it.

JAKE
What is this?

MR. HAN
An answer. To a question you haven't asked yet.

JAKE
I have a lot of questions.

MR. HAN
Start with this one: do you know who signs your checks?

Jake's eyes narrow.

JAKE
The State Department. Language and Cultural Exchange Program.

MR. HAN
(slight smile)
That's your teacher salary. I'm asking about the other one.

Beat. Jake's mask slips, just for a moment.

JAKE
(flat)
I don't know what you're talking about.

MR. HAN
Mr. Cooper. I've been doing this since before you were born. Don't insult us both.

He taps the folder.

MR. HAN (CONT'D)
Your Agency. The men who give you orders. The drops in Yongsan. The coded broadcasts. I know all of it.

Jake's hand moves toward the folder. Stops.

JAKE
Then what do you want from me?

MR. HAN
I want you to open the folder. And then I want you to tell me who you see.

Jake opens the folder. Inside: PHOTOGRAPHS. Official documents. Names he recognizes.

His expression shifts - confusion to concern.

JAKE
These are... these are my contacts. How did you--

MR. HAN
Look at the last page.

Jake flips to the end. A PHOTOGRAPH of MR. KIM - the man from the black sedan. But next to it, another photo. The same face, younger. In a North Korean military uniform.

JAKE
(breath catching)
That's not possible.

MR. HAN
Many things seem impossible until they're not.

JAKE
Kim works for the South. He recruited me. He--

MR. HAN
(cutting him off, gentle)
Mr. Kim works for the people who pay him most. Today, that is Pyongyang. Tomorrow, who knows? Loyalty is expensive. He sells to the highest bidder.

Jake stares at the photo. His world tilting.

JAKE
Why are you telling me this?

MR. HAN
Because you have a choice to make. And I believe you deserve to make it with open eyes.

JAKE
A choice between what?

MR. HAN
(leaning back)
That's for you to discover. I'm just an old man who serves tea and shares photographs.

He finishes his tea. Rises.

MR. HAN (CONT'D)
Study the folder. Verify what you can. And when you're ready to ask the right question--

JAKE
What's the right question?

MR. HAN
(at the door, turning back)
Not "who am I working for." The right question is "who do I want to be?"

He walks out.

Jake sits alone. The folder open. His certainties crumbling.

He picks up the photograph of Kim. His hands are shaking.

JAKE
(to himself)
Who do I want to be?

He doesn't have an answer.

INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

[[Scene 10B: Overhead shot, dim table lamp]]

The folder from Mr. Han spread across Jake's desk. PHOTOGRAPHS and DOCUMENTS scattered.

Jake leans heavily over the desk, shuffling the photographs. He stops at one particular photo, his face tightening with realization.

INT. ITAEWON BAR - NIGHT

[[Scene 10A: Jake reports to Aaron - Dramatic irony, audience knows Aaron's allegiance]]

The same bar from Scene 3B. Quieter now. Late night. Most of the crowd has gone home.

Jake sits in a back booth. Aaron slides in across from him, looking concerned. He's carrying two bottles of OB beer.

AARON
(setting down the beers)
You sounded serious on the phone. What's going on?

Jake hesitates. Looks around the bar. An old habit.

JAKE
(low)
I met someone tonight. A man named Han.

AARON
(leaning forward, concerned)
Han? Should I know that name?

JAKE
He knows things, Aaron. About Kim. About my operations.

Aaron's expression shifts - worry, but beneath it, something calculating. He covers it by taking a long drink.

AARON
What kind of things?

JAKE
He had a folder. Photographs. Documents I've never seen before.

AARON
(nervous laugh)
That's... I mean, that's not good, right? Someone outside the chain having access to your--

JAKE
There was a photo of Kim. In a North Korean uniform.

Aaron freezes mid-drink. Sets the bottle down slowly. His eyes are very still.

AARON
(carefully)
That could be anything. Disinformation. The North loves to plant stuff like this. Create distrust.

JAKE
Han said Kim works for whoever pays him most. Today that's Pyongyang.

AARON
(shaking his head)
Jake, listen to me. I've heard these kinds of rumors before. They float through the embassy all the time. Half of them are garbage, the other half are psyops.

He reaches across the table. Places his hand on Jake's arm - a gesture of friendship.

AARON (CONT'D)
What exactly did the folder contain? Like, specifically. I'm trying to think if any of it lines up with anything I've seen come through the office.

Jake studies Aaron's face. The concern seems genuine. The questions seem helpful.

JAKE
Operational reports. Names I recognized. Dates of missions.

AARON
(nodding, processing)
Okay. Okay, that's... that's detailed. Too detailed for random disinformation.
(beat)
Did Han say where he got it?

JAKE
No. He just said I deserve to make choices with open eyes.

Aaron sits back. Runs his hand through his thinning hair - the nervous gesture.

AARON
Look, I'm not field agent material. You know that. But I do have contacts at the embassy. People who handle verification. I could... quietly ask around? See if anyone's heard anything about Kim?

Jake considers this. The offer seems generous. Helpful.

JAKE
(cautious)
I don't want to expose this to the wrong people.

AARON
(earnest)
Neither do I. That's why I'm saying quietly. Off the books.
(leaning in)
Jake, we Americans gotta stick together out here. If something's wrong with your operation, I want to help you figure it out before it blows up in your face.

A long moment. Jake weighing trust against paranoia.

JAKE
(finally)
Just... be careful. If any of this is real--

AARON
(cutting him off)
If any of this is real, you need to know. And I want to help.

He raises his beer.

AARON (CONT'D)
Partners?

Jake hesitates. Then touches his bottle to Aaron's.

JAKE
Partners.

They drink. Aaron's smile is warm, friendly, reassuring.

But as Jake looks away, Aaron's eyes change. Harder. More focused. He's memorizing every detail.

EXT. ITAEWON STREET - MOMENTS LATER

[[Scene 10C: Aaron's true face - Neon shadows, double life revealed]]

Aaron walks alone through the neon-lit streets. His posture has changed - more purposeful, less bumbling.

He ducks into an alley. Pulls out a small notebook. Writes quickly:

"Han - folder - North photo - Kim exposed?"

He tears out the page. Folds it precisely.

At the end of the alley, a PAYPHONE. Aaron deposits coins. Dials a number from memory.

AARON
(into phone, flat voice - no nervous energy now)
It's me. We have a problem.
(listening)
The American made contact with someone named Han. He has documentation.
(pause)
Yes. That documentation.
(beat)
I'll stay close. But you should know - he's asking questions now.

He hangs up. Stands motionless for a moment.

Then Aaron Mitchell transforms back - shoulders hunching, nervous energy returning - and walks out of the alley like any other harmless American bureaucrat heading home.

## SEQUENCE 3 - UNDERGROUND

= Jake flees through Seoul's underbelly, leading to his first direct confrontation.

INT. SEWER SYSTEM - NIGHT

[[Scene 11: Low-angle tracking shot, flashlight beam]]

Jake climbs down into the sewer. His breathing labored. He uses a flashlight to navigate the narrow, damp tunnel.

Water drips. Rats scatter. Jake moves fast, splashing through ankle-deep water.

He stops. Listens.

Footsteps behind him. Measured. Patient.

JAKE
(under breath)
Come on. Come on.

He kills the flashlight. Presses against the damp wall.

The footsteps continue. Getting closer.

INT. SEWER INTERSECTION - NIGHT

[[Scene 12: Close-up alternating shots, flashlight illumination]]

Jake reaches an intersection. Three tunnels branch off. He chooses left--

A FLASHLIGHT BEAM catches him from behind.

PURSUER (O.S.)
Wrong way, Mr. Cooper.

Jake freezes. Turns slowly. The Pursuer stands twenty feet back - professional stance, hand inside his jacket.

JAKE
(flat)
Who are you?

PURSUER
Someone who's been following you for six months. You're not as careful as you think.

JAKE
If you wanted me dead, I'd be dead.

PURSUER
(slight smile)
True.

Beat. Water drips between them.

PURSUER (CONT'D)
The package you delivered last week. What did you think was in it?

JAKE
Documents. Intel.

PURSUER
It was names. South Korean assets. Four of them are dead now.

Jake's jaw tightens.

JAKE
You're lying.

PURSUER
Am I? Ask yourself - have you ever met your handler? In person?

Silence. The question hangs.

PURSUER (CONT'D)
(in Korean; subtitled)
넌 잘못된 편에 서 있어, 미국인. 아직 모를 뿐이지.
*You're on the wrong side, American. You just don't know it yet.*

The Pursuer steps back into darkness.

PURSUER (CONT'D)
(English)
The warehouse. Tonight. Midnight. Come alone.

His flashlight clicks off. Footsteps receding.

Jake stands in the dark. Alone with the rats and the doubt.

JAKE
(barely audible)
Damn it.

EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY

[[Scene 13: Wide shot from behind, natural daylight]]

Jake emerges from a manhole onto a busy street. A delivery truck covers his exit.

He blends with the crowd instantly. Baseball cap pulled low. Eyes scanning.

A PAYPHONE on the corner. Jake crosses to it. Drops coins. Dials.

JAKE
(into phone, low)
Songbird checking in. I need to verify my handler's identity. Authorization code delta-seven.

Static. Then:

VOICE (V.O.)
(filtered)
Songbird, your handler is secure. Proceed with mission parameters.

JAKE
I need a name. A face. Something concrete.

VOICE (V.O.)
That's not protocol, Songbird.

JAKE
Protocol just got three people killed.

Long pause.

VOICE (V.O.)
Continue current operations. We'll review your concerns at next scheduled contact.

CLICK. Line dead.

Jake hangs up. Stares at the phone.

JAKE
(under breath)
Review my concerns.

He pulls his cap lower. Disappears into the crowd.

# ACT TWO

## SEQUENCE 4 - THE OLD FRIEND

= Jake reunites with Sung-ho, and they begin to plan.

INT. SUNG-HO'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY

[[Scene 14: Medium close-up from inside, warm interior lighting]]

Jake knocks on a weathered apartment door. After a tense pause, SUNG-HO, Korean, 40s, opens it, startled.

Sung-ho's face cycles through shock, relief, then concern in rapid succession.

SUNG-HO
(in Korean; subtitled)
야! 이 미친 자식아.
*Ya! You crazy bastard.*

JAKE
(quiet, in Korean; subtitled)
안녕, 형.
*Hi, hyung.*

SUNG-HO
(switching to English, urgent)
Two years. Two years, no word. Now you knock on my door in daylight?

JAKE
I know. I'm sorry.

SUNG-HO
(looking past Jake, checking the hall)
Sorry doesn't fix stupid.

They share a brief, intense look. Sung-ho pulls Jake inside, closing the door behind them.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(as door closes)
Get in before someone sees you.

INT. SUNG-HO'S APARTMENT - DAY (FLASHBACK - 1991)

[[Scene 14A: Flashback - Two years earlier, establishing Jake and Sung-ho's bond]]

A TITLE CARD: "TWO YEARS EARLIER"

The same apartment, but different. Cleaner. Brighter. A woman's presence visible - flowers by the window, a photo of Sung-ho with his wife and young sister.

JAKE, younger-looking, cleaner-cut, sits across from SUNG-HO. Between them, a bottle of soju and two glasses. But the atmosphere is tense, not friendly.

SUNG-HO
(in Korean; subtitled)
미국 사람들은 왜 항상 도움을 주고 싶어 해?
*Why do Americans always want to "help"?*

JAKE
(in Korean, less fluent than present-day; subtitled)
당신 여동생이... 문제가 있어요. 내가 도울 수 있어요.
*Your sister has... a problem. I can help.*

SUNG-HO
(bitter)
What do you want in return? Everyone wants something.

JAKE
(switching to English)
Nothing.

SUNG-HO
(scoffing)
Nothing. An American says nothing.

Jake reaches into his pocket. Pulls out a small PHOTOGRAPH. Slides it across the table.

Sung-ho looks at it. His face changes - fear, then fury.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(grabbing Jake's collar)
Where did you get this?

JAKE
(not resisting)
The same people who are watching her. The same people who plan to use her.

SUNG-HO
Use her for what?

JAKE
Your sister works at the National Assembly. She has access to committee schedules, meeting agendas. Someone's been cultivating her for six months.

Sung-ho releases Jake. Sits back. His hands are shaking.

SUNG-HO
(quiet)
She told me she met someone. An older man. Important.

JAKE
He's North Korean intelligence. They're building a network. Your sister is a piece they want on the board.

SUNG-HO
(despairing)
Then it's over. Once they have their hooks in--

JAKE
It's not over. I can get her out. New job. New city. New identity if necessary.

SUNG-HO
Why would you do this?

A long beat. Jake looks at the photograph of Sung-ho's family.

JAKE
(quiet)
Because no one should be used like that. Turned into something they didn't choose.
(beat)
I know what that feels like.

Sung-ho studies Jake's face. Something genuine there. Something broken, maybe.

SUNG-HO
(in Korean; subtitled)
당신도 누군가에게 이용당했어?
*Someone used you too?*

Jake doesn't answer. He doesn't have to.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(deciding)
If you help my sister... I will owe you. A debt I cannot repay.

JAKE
I don't want a debt. I want a friend.
(beat)
Someone real. In a city full of lies.

Sung-ho considers this. Then pours two glasses of soju. Slides one to Jake.

SUNG-HO
(raising glass)
친구가 되는 건 빚을 갚는 것보다 어려워.
*Being a friend is harder than repaying a debt.*

JAKE
(raising his)
I know.

They drink. The beginning of something.

INT. SUNG-HO'S APARTMENT - DAY (PRESENT)

[[Scene 15: Over-the-shoulder shot, warm dim lighting]]

Jake and Sung-ho sit on the floor around a low table. SOJU bottles between them. Documents spread across the table.

The apartment is small, cluttered with books and old newspapers. A photo of a young woman on a shelf - Sung-ho's sister.

Sung-ho watches Jake, who stares at nothing. Neither has spoken.

SUNG-HO
(finally)
When did you last eat?

JAKE
I don't remember.

Sung-ho rises. Goes to a small kitchen area. Returns with leftover rice and kimchi in a plastic container.

SUNG-HO
Eat.

JAKE
I'm not hungry.

SUNG-HO
(firm)
Eat. Then we talk.

Jake picks at the food. His hands are shaking slightly. Sung-ho notices but says nothing.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
My neighbor saw you come in. She'll tell everyone an American is visiting.

JAKE
I'm sorry. I didn't know where else--

SUNG-HO
(cutting him off)
Stop apologizing. Tell me what happened.

Jake sets down the chopsticks. Takes a breath.

JAKE
I've been in Seoul two years. You know what I do.

SUNG-HO
I know what you told me. CIA. Intelligence work. "Making a difference."

There's something in his tone. Jake catches it.

JAKE
You didn't believe me?

SUNG-HO
I believed you believed it.

Beat. Jake doesn't know how to take that.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
Go on.

JAKE
Three weeks ago, everything stopped. My handler - a voice on a phone, I never met him in person - went silent. My drop points were cleaned out. Then someone tried to grab me near Yongsan Station.

SUNG-HO
Grab you. Not kill you?

JAKE
They had a van. Flex cuffs. They wanted me alive.

SUNG-HO
Who?

JAKE
Korean. Not military - wrong haircuts. Not police. Maybe--

SUNG-HO
Maybe KCIA.

JAKE
Maybe.

Sung-ho pours soju into two small glasses. Slides one across.

SUNG-HO
(in Korean; subtitled)
혼란을 위하여.
*To confusion.*

They drink.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(back to English)
Show me.

Jake spreads documents across the table. Photos. Reports. A crude map with handwritten notes.

JAKE
This is two years of work. Every contact. Every operation. Every piece of intelligence I gathered.

Sung-ho studies a photo. His brow furrows.

SUNG-HO
This man. You know who this is?

JAKE
North Korean asset. Code name "Sparrow." My handler flagged him for surveillance.

SUNG-HO
(quiet)
This man is my wife's cousin.

Jake freezes.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
He works at a fish market in Busan. He's not a spy, Jake. He's an accountant.

JAKE
That's... that can't be right.

SUNG-HO
(pointing to another photo)
And this one?

JAKE
Another target. "Magpie." Suspected courier.

SUNG-HO
She teaches Sunday school at my church.

Jake stares at the photos. The room suddenly feels very small.

JAKE
What the hell is going on?

INT. SUNG-HO'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 16: Close-up on Jake, warm table lamp]]

Jake is pacing now. Sung-ho remains seated, watching.

JAKE
Two years. I gave them two years.

SUNG-HO
Gave who?

JAKE
(stopping)
I don't know anymore.

He crouches. Starts arranging papers in a new pattern.

JAKE (CONT'D)
I thought I was building something. A network. Intelligence that mattered. Operations that made a difference.

SUNG-HO
And now?

JAKE
Now I'm looking at innocent people I marked as enemies. Reports for missions I never ran. A career that might have been smoke the whole time.

He lines up three operation reports.

JAKE (CONT'D)
These three dates. February fifteenth. March third. April twenty-second.

SUNG-HO
What about them?

JAKE
All three were days I couldn't have been operational. Hospital. Surveillance. And this one--
(pointing)
April twenty-second was Easter. I was at an American church service in Itaewon. Surrounded by Marines.

He slams his hand on the table. Sung-ho flinches.

JAKE (CONT'D)
Bulletproof alibis. For missions someone else completed in my name.

SUNG-HO
Why would they need alibis?

JAKE
(the realization hitting)
Because when it all falls apart, I'm the one holding the evidence. I'm the one who looks guilty.

SUNG-HO
Guilty of what?

Jake looks at his friend. The weight of it crushing him.

JAKE
Whatever they've been doing. Whatever these missions actually were.
(beat)
I'm the fall guy, hyung. That's all I've ever been.

INT. SUNG-HO'S APARTMENT - LATER

[[Scene 17: High-angle shot on map, warm hanging light]]

A large MAP spread across the floor. Jake and Sung-ho sit cross-legged, leaning over it. Empty soju bottles pushed aside.

Jake's finger traces a path through the financial district.

JAKE
Kim's building. Here.

SUNG-HO
Security?

JAKE
Heavy. Two lobby guards, one in the garage.

SUNG-HO
Cameras?

JAKE
Everywhere. But there's a forty-second gap in the rotation at the service entrance.

Sung-ho adds a note beside the building.

SUNG-HO
I know a better way.

Jake looks up.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
Building next door. Older. Worse security. Roof access connects through a maintenance hatch.

JAKE
You've been there?

SUNG-HO
(beat)
I wasn't always a good man, Jake.

JAKE
You're a good man now.

SUNG-HO
(ignoring this)
We go in through the neighbor. Down through the hatch. Kim's floor is fourth.
(drawing the path)
Here.

JAKE
What about the electronic locks?

SUNG-HO
(producing a small device from his pocket)
Radio Shack. Amazing what you can build.

Jake almost smiles. Sung-ho doesn't.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
This is dangerous.

JAKE
I know.

SUNG-HO
You could run. Leave Korea. Start over somewhere they can't find you.

JAKE
Could you?

Sung-ho considers this. Then:

SUNG-HO
No. I couldn't.

He makes a final mark on the map.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
One o'clock. Midnight shift change gives us the smallest crew.

JAKE
One o'clock.

They exchange serious glances.

SUNG-HO
(in Korean; subtitled)
우리 둘 다 바보가 아니길 바라자.
*Let's hope we're not both idiots.*

JAKE
(in Korean; subtitled)
이미 늦었어.
*Too late for that.*

INT. SUNG-HO'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

[[Scene 18: Medium shot, low warm lighting]]

Jake kneels by his BACKPACK, organizing items quickly but meticulously. Flashlight. Lock picks. A small camera.

Sung-ho approaches. Holds out a small, old-fashioned WALKIE-TALKIE.

SUNG-HO
Channel seven. Two clicks for clear.

Jake takes it. Their hands touch briefly.

JAKE
Where'd you get this?

SUNG-HO
Same place I got everything else. Don't ask.

Jake stands. They face each other.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
The photo of my sister. On the shelf.

Jake looks at it. The young woman, smiling.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
She's married now. Two children. Living in Busan.

JAKE
I didn't know.

SUNG-HO
Because of you. What you did for her... I never said thank you.

JAKE
You didn't have to.

SUNG-HO
I'm saying it now.

Beat. The weight of history between them.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(lighter)
Now go. Before I change my mind and make you stay here forever.

JAKE
(almost smiling)
Your cooking would kill me first.

SUNG-HO
(in Korean; subtitled)
버릇없는 미국놈.
*Disrespectful American.*

JAKE
(in Korean; subtitled)
고집불통 한국인.
*Stubborn Korean.*

Jake shoulders the backpack. Moves to the door.

SUNG-HO
Jake.

He turns.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
Whatever you find in there... whatever the truth is... it doesn't change who you are.

JAKE
I don't know who I am.

SUNG-HO
(simple)
You're my friend. That's enough.

Jake holds his gaze. Nods once.

Then he's gone.

Sung-ho stands alone in the apartment. Looks at the map still spread on the floor.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(to himself, in Korean; subtitled)
바보들. 둘 다.
*Stupid. Both of us.*

He crosses to the window. Watches Jake disappear into the night.

EXT. SUNG-HO'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

[[Scene 18A: Aaron "helps" with planning - Actually compromising the operation]]

Jake exits the building, backpack over shoulder. He moves with purpose, heading toward the main street.

A figure steps out of the shadows. AARON MITCHELL. He's been waiting.

JAKE
(tensing, hand near jacket)
Jesus. Aaron. What are you doing here?

AARON
(hands up, apologetic)
Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to spook you.
(beat)
I did some digging. On that Kim thing you told me about. I think I found something.

Jake looks around. The street is quiet. Too quiet.

JAKE
(suspicious)
How did you know I was here?

AARON
(slight smile)
I know a lot of places, Jake. Embassy work isn't all stamps and paperwork.
(pulling out a folded paper)
Look, I found a name. Someone at the embassy who knew Kim back in the eighties. Before he went dark.

Jake takes the paper. Examines it in the dim light.

JAKE
Colonel Patterson?

AARON
Retired now. Lives in Yongsan. He might have information about Kim's real allegiances.

JAKE
(folding the paper)
Why are you telling me this?

AARON
(earnest)
Because you're going to do something dangerous tonight. I can see it. The backpack, the route through the back alleys...
(stepping closer)
I want to help. Let me help.

Jake studies Aaron's face. The concern seems genuine.

JAKE
I'm meeting a contact. Someone who might have more intel on Kim's network.

AARON
(nodding)
Where?

Beat. Jake hesitates.

AARON (CONT'D)
Jake, I'm not asking for details. I just... if something goes wrong, I want to know where to send help.

JAKE
(deciding)
Industrial district. Old textile warehouse near Yeongdeungpo.

Aaron nods. Files the information away.

AARON
Time?

JAKE
After midnight.

AARON
(reaching into his pocket)
Take this.

He hands Jake a small DEVICE - looks like a pager.

AARON (CONT'D)
Emergency beacon. Press and hold for three seconds. It pings a frequency the embassy monitors.

Jake examines it. Functional. Simple.

JAKE
Where did you get this?

AARON
(shrugging)
Connections. The visa stamping isn't as boring as I make it sound.

Jake pockets the device.

JAKE
Thanks.

AARON
Hey. Americans stick together.
(beat, something almost genuine)
Be careful, okay? Kim's people... they play rough.

JAKE
I know.

Jake starts walking. Aaron watches him go.

AARON
(calling after him)
Jake?

Jake turns.

AARON (CONT'D)
If you don't make contact by dawn... I'll know something's wrong.

JAKE
(nodding)
Dawn.

Jake disappears into the night.

Aaron stands alone. His friendly expression fades. He pulls out his notebook again. Writes:

"Warehouse. Yeongdeungpo. After midnight."

Then adds: "Device planted."

He tears out the page. Folds it. Tucks it into his jacket.

The "emergency beacon" he gave Jake? Not what he said it was. But Jake doesn't know that.

Aaron Mitchell walks in the opposite direction, hands in pockets, whistling softly.

Just a helpful American. Looking out for a friend.

## SEQUENCE 5 - THE WAREHOUSE

= The first major confrontation.

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

[[Scene 19: Wide shot, flashlight as primary light]]

Jake enters cautiously, flashlight revealing old machinery and dusty corners. A shadow moves in the distance.

JAKE
(calling out, low)
Hello?

His flashlight sweeps the space. Rusted conveyor belts. Stacked pallets. A rat scurries.

UNKNOWN MAN (O.S.)
Turn that off.

Jake complies. Darkness.

UNKNOWN MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Good. Now walk forward. Twenty steps.

Jake walks. Counting silently. His footsteps echo.

UNKNOWN MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Stop.

A single WORK LIGHT clicks on - harsh, industrial. Jake squints.

The UNKNOWN MAN steps into the light. Korean, 40s, forgettable face. The kind of man you'd never remember. He holds a BRIEFCASE.

UNKNOWN MAN
You're late.

JAKE
I was being careful.

UNKNOWN MAN
No. You were deciding whether to come at all.

Beat. He's right.

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 20: Over-the-shoulder shot, flashlight and moonlight]]

Jake and the Unknown Man face each other. Ten feet apart.

JAKE
The man in the sewer. He works for you?

UNKNOWN MAN
He works for the same people I do. The same people you do.

JAKE
And who is that?

UNKNOWN MAN
(slight smile)
That's the question, isn't it?

He sets the briefcase on a crate between them.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
Open it.

JAKE
What's inside?

UNKNOWN MAN
Proof. Of what you've been doing for the past two years.

Jake doesn't move.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
You're afraid. Good. Fear means you're starting to understand.

JAKE
Understand what?

UNKNOWN MAN
That everything you believe about yourself is a lie.

Jake steps forward. Opens the briefcase.

Inside: FILES. PHOTOGRAPHS. Operational reports - some with Jake's code name. Some with faces he recognizes. Korean men and women.

JAKE
(scanning documents)
These are my reports. My operations.

UNKNOWN MAN
Keep reading.

Jake flips through. Stops at a photograph. A man - dead. Execution style.

JAKE
(quiet)
Who is this?

UNKNOWN MAN
Agent Yoo. South Korean intelligence. You delivered a package last October. He was dead within the week.

Jake's hand trembles.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
Page twelve.

Jake turns to it. More photos. More dead faces.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
Agent Park. Agent Lee. Agent Kim - no relation to your Mr. Kim, ironically. All eliminated after you provided their locations, their covers, their patterns.

JAKE
(barely audible)
I didn't know.

UNKNOWN MAN
No. You didn't. That's the clever part.

Jake looks up. The Unknown Man's face is unreadable.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
You were recruited by a man claiming to be CIA. Given training. A cover. A purpose. You believed because you wanted to believe.

JAKE
Who are you?

UNKNOWN MAN
A middleman. Like you. Except I know who signs my checks.

JAKE
Then tell me.

The Unknown Man considers this.

UNKNOWN MAN
The man you know as Mr. Kim. He's not Agency. He's not South Korean intelligence. He runs a network for Pyongyang. Has for twenty years.

Jake's world tilts.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
You've been a North Korean asset since the day you arrived in Seoul. You just didn't know it.

JAKE
That's not possible. I was vetted--

UNKNOWN MAN
You were cultivated. Big difference.

He reaches into his jacket. Jake tenses. The Unknown Man pulls out a PIECE OF PAPER.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
An address. A real CIA officer - actual Agency. He's expecting you. Bring the briefcase.

JAKE
Why would I trust you?

UNKNOWN MAN
You shouldn't. But you can verify everything in that case. And when you do, you'll know I'm telling the truth.

He steps back into darkness.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
One more thing. Kim knows you're here. He's cleaning house. Everyone connected to this operation.

JAKE
Including you?

UNKNOWN MAN
(from darkness)
Including me.

Silence.

JAKE
Wait--

A CRASH from somewhere in the warehouse. Jake spins.

The Unknown Man is gone.

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 21: Handheld shaky medium shot, rolling flashlight]]

An ATTACKER bursts from behind a crate. Black-clad. Fast.

UNKNOWN MAN (O.S.)
Down!

Jake ducks. The Attacker's blade whistles past his head.

The Unknown Man pulls a pistol - fires twice. The shots ECHO. The Attacker staggers but keeps coming.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
(Korean; subtitled)
뛰어! 빨리!
*Run! Now!*

A SECOND ATTACKER emerges from the shadows.

Jake grabs the briefcase. Sprints.

Behind him - struggle. A gunshot. A cry.

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 22: Tracking shot from behind, dynamic lighting]]

Jake runs through the cluttered warehouse. Briefcase clutched to his chest.

ATTACKER #2 (O.S.)
(Korean, shouting; subtitled)
파일을 가지고 있어! 놓치지 마!
*He has the files! Don't let him leave!*

Jake vaults a conveyor belt. Crashes through a stack of pallets.

More FOOTSTEPS behind him. Multiple.

JAKE
(gasping)
Exit. Find an exit.

He spots a window ahead - grimy glass, weak frame.

Behind him, closer now:

ATTACKER #2 (O.S.)
(Korean; subtitled)
막아! 막아!
*Corner him! Corner him!*

Jake doesn't slow down. Aims for the window.

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - WINDOW - NIGHT

[[Scene 23: Low-angle shot from outside, streetlamp and moonlight]]

Jake hits the window shoulder-first.

Glass SHATTERS. He drops eight feet. Lands hard. Rolls.

ATTACKER (O.S.)
(from window above, Korean)
Get to the street! Cut him off!

Jake scrambles up. The briefcase is still in his grip.

He runs.

Behind him, the warehouse lights up - flashlights, shouting, chaos.

Jake disappears into the night.

EXT. BACKSTREET - NIGHT

[[Scene 24: Medium side shot, mixed lighting]]

Jake stumbles out of an alley. Leans against a brick wall. Gasping.

Pedestrians walk past. A drunk businessman. A couple arguing. Normal life.

Jake forces himself upright. Checks his reflection in a shop window.

Blood on his jacket. Torn fabric. He looks like what he is - a man who just escaped something terrible.

JAKE
(to himself)
Blend. Blend in.

He buttons his jacket to hide the blood. Wipes his face. Steps into the flow of pedestrians.

Just another foreigner walking home.

EXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT

[[Scene 25: Low-angle close-up, flickering overhead light]]

Jake ducks into a narrow alley. Crouches beside old crates.

He sets down the briefcase. Clicks it open. The documents are still there.

Then he remembers - the paper. The address.

He reaches into his pocket. Pulls out a crumpled piece of paper - the one the Unknown Man gave him.

Jake holds it up to the flickering light.

An address. Itaewon district. And a name: CAPTAIN REEVES.

Below it, handwritten:

"He knows what you are. He can make you something else."

Jake stares at the words.

JAKE
(quiet)
Something else.

He folds the paper. Tucks it into his shirt pocket - close to his chest.

In the distance, SIRENS.

Jake picks up the briefcase. Moves deeper into the shadows.

## SEQUENCE 6 - THE CRACK

= Jake reviews his intel and notices something that doesn't add up. The first crack in his certainty.

INT. SUBURBAN HOME - KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)

[[Scene 26: Medium shot, warm morning light]]

YOUNG JAKE, teenage, sits at a kitchen table with his MOTHER. They discuss an opportunity in Korea. His mother looks worried but supportive.

MOTHER
You're sure this is what you want? It's so far away.

YOUNG JAKE
It's a chance to be someone, Mom. To matter.

She places her hand gently on his arm.

MOTHER
You already matter. You know that, right?

Young Jake looks away. He doesn't believe her.

INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (PRESENT)

[[Scene 27: MIDPOINT REVERSAL - Single lamp, shadows, revelation]]

Jake sits on the floor surrounded by documents. The folder from Mr. Han. Photos. The intel from his Agency contacts. Reports from Mr. Kim.

He's cross-referencing. Something bothers him.

JAKE
(muttering)
This doesn't make sense.

He holds up two photographs side by side. The SAME MAN - but one photo is labeled as a North Korean agent, the other as a South Korean asset.

JAKE (CONT'D)
Wait...

He shuffles through more papers. Finds a date discrepancy. An operation report claims Jake delivered a package on March 3rd. But he was in the hospital that day. Food poisoning. He remembers it clearly.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(growing alarm)
I wasn't even there. I was sick. Who...

His phone RINGS. Jake freezes. Stares at it.

It rings again. He answers.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(cautious)
Yeah?

MR. KIM (V.O.)
(filtered)
Mr. Cooper. I trust you received the updated intelligence.

JAKE
I'm looking at it now.

MR. KIM (V.O.)
Good. The target will be at the location tomorrow night. Don't be late.

Jake looks at the contradicting photos.

JAKE
Who verified this intel?

Silence on the line.

MR. KIM (V.O.)
(colder)
That's not your concern. Your concern is completing the mission.

JAKE
I'm asking because something doesn't--

MR. KIM (V.O.)
(sharp)
Questions are dangerous, Mr. Cooper. Especially the wrong ones.

CLICK. Line goes dead.

Jake stares at the phone. Then at the documents.

JAKE
(quietly, to himself)
What the hell is going on?

He looks at the map on his wall. All those pins. All those connections. What if they're wrong? What if they've always been wrong?

His fingers start tapping the floor. Nervous habit.

For the first time since he arrived in Seoul, Jake Cooper doesn't know what's true.

He picks up his phone. Hesitates. Then dials.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - MYEONGDONG - LATER

[[Scene 27A: Jake confronts Aaron about discrepancy - Aaron deflects]]

A small, anonymous coffee shop. Foreign tourists cluster near the windows. Jake sits in a back corner, the operation report spread before him.

Aaron enters. Spots Jake. Slides into the booth across from him, already talking.

AARON
(apologetic)
Sorry I'm late. The traffic near Namdaemun is insane tonight.
(noticing Jake's expression)
What's wrong?

Jake slides the operation report across the table.

JAKE
(flat)
Look at the date.

AARON
(picking it up, squinting)
March third. Operation... Yoo?
(beat)
What about it?

JAKE
I was in the hospital March third. Food poisoning. I couldn't have delivered anything.

Aaron's brow furrows. He studies the report. His lips move slightly, as if reading.

AARON
(slowly)
That's... huh.

JAKE
That's not "huh," Aaron. That's a problem. Someone ran an operation under my code name while I was unconscious in a hospital bed.

AARON
(wiping hands on pants - the nervous tell)
Let me think...
(beat)
March third. March third.

He snaps his fingers.

AARON (CONT'D)
Oh! That was the Yoo thing, right? The delivery to the Itaewon safehouse?

JAKE
How do you know about that?

AARON
(quickly)
Embassy traffic. Some of the operation reports pass through our communications office for encoding.
(beat)
The dates got scrambled in transmission - happens more than you'd think with the encryption protocols we use. Half the time I get cables dated from next week.

Jake studies him. Aaron meets his gaze - nervous, bumbling, sincere.

JAKE
(suspicious)
So someone just... mislabeled the date?

AARON
Or the transmission timestamp got corrupted. The Agency's encryption is good, but the infrastructure here...
(shrugging)
It's 1993 Seoul, not the Pentagon.

JAKE
This report says I identified Agent Yoo as a surveillance risk.

AARON
Did you?

JAKE
I don't know. I don't remember.

Aaron leans forward. Concerned friend.

AARON
Jake, you've been running hot for weeks. Stress does things to memory. Trust me, I've seen it before.
(lowering voice)
After what you told me about Kim... the photos... maybe you're seeing patterns that aren't there?

JAKE
(hardening)
Three operations. Three dates I have alibis for. That's not a pattern, that's evidence.

AARON
Evidence of what? Clerical errors? Bad encoding?
(genuine worry)
Or evidence that you're starting to crack?

The question lands. Jake looks away.

AARON (CONT'D)
(softer)
I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm saying before you go full conspiracy theory, we should verify. Let me check the embassy records. Cross-reference the transmission logs.

JAKE
Why would you do that?

AARON
Because you're my friend. And because if something is actually wrong here, I want to help fix it.
(beat)
And if nothing's wrong, maybe you can stop looking over your shoulder long enough to sleep.

Jake considers. The offer is reasonable. Helpful.

JAKE
(finally)
Fine. Check the records.

AARON
(relieved)
I'll have something by tomorrow. Meet me at the usual place, noon.

He slides the report back to Jake. Their fingers brush.

AARON (CONT'D)
Jake?

JAKE
Yeah?

AARON
(meeting his eyes)
Try to get some rest. You look like hell.

Jake almost smiles.

JAKE
Thanks.

AARON
(standing)
That's what friends are for.

He walks out. Pauses at the door. Turns back with a small wave.

Jake watches him go. Something still bothers him. But he can't identify what.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 27B: Aaron's mask slips - Cold streets, colder purpose]]

Aaron exits. His expression shifts immediately - the nervous energy replaced by cold focus.

He pulls out his notebook. Writes quickly:

"March 3rd - he found the discrepancy. Yoo operation exposed."

Below it: "Deflected. Bought 24 hours."

He underlines the last part twice.

Then Aaron Mitchell walks into the Myeongdong crowds, already composing the next message for his handlers.

## SEQUENCE 7 - THE RIVER

= Jake and Sung-ho plan their next move by the Han River.

EXT. HAN RIVERBANK - NIGHT

[[Scene 28: Wide shot, city lights reflecting]]

Jake waits on the edge of the Han River. City lights reflect in the water. Sung-ho approaches. They exchange a silent nod.

SUNG-HO
(low, in Korean; subtitled)
미행 없었어?
*You weren't followed?*

JAKE
Three changes. Doubled back twice.

SUNG-HO
Good.

He settles beside Jake. Both stare at the water.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
The meeting with Park's contact. It's confirmed?

JAKE
Dawn. Industrial district.

SUNG-HO
(nodding slowly)
Then we move.

EXT. HAN RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 29: Over-the-shoulder shot, moonlight and city lighting]]

Jake and Sung-ho sit side-by-side, talking in hushed tones. Jake points out a building in the distance.

JAKE
(pointing)
See that building? The one with the red light on top?

SUNG-HO
The textile factory?

JAKE
Used to be. Now it's a front for Kim's logistics.

SUNG-HO
How do you know?

JAKE
I delivered there. Twice. Never knew what was in the packages.

SUNG-HO
(grim)
Now you do.

JAKE
Now I do.

Beat. The weight of that knowledge between them.

SUNG-HO
The contact - he'll have equipment?

JAKE
Radio transmitter. Frequencies for the embassy. Everything we need to blow this open.

SUNG-HO
(skeptical)
And you trust him?

JAKE
I don't trust anyone. But I'm out of options.

EXT. HAN RIVERBANK - DOCK - NIGHT

[[Scene 30: Medium shot from water, moonlight on water]]

Jake and Sung-ho prepare to cross the river. A small, hidden BOAT tied to the dock.

Jake pulls back a tarp, revealing the weathered boat.

SUNG-HO
(eyeing it)
This is your plan? We'll sink before we're halfway.

JAKE
It floated when I hid it here.

SUNG-HO
When was that?

JAKE
Six months ago.

SUNG-HO
(muttering in Korean; subtitled)
우리 죽는다.
*We're going to die.*

Jake unties the rope. Holds the boat steady.

JAKE
Get in. Stay low.

Sung-ho climbs in. The boat groans but holds.

SUNG-HO
If I drown, I'm haunting you.

JAKE
(pushing off)
Get in line.

EXT. HAN RIVER - NIGHT

[[Scene 31: Wide aerial shot, moonlight reflecting]]

Jake and Sung-ho row across the Han River. City lights glisten in the distance.

Long silence. Just the sound of oars cutting water.

SUNG-HO
(quiet)
What happens after?

JAKE
After what?

SUNG-HO
After you give them everything. Kim's network. The operations. What happens to you?

Jake keeps rowing. Doesn't answer.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
Jake.

JAKE
(flat)
I don't know. Prison, maybe. If they believe me.

SUNG-HO
And if they don't?

JAKE
Then it doesn't matter.

More silence. The far shore grows closer.

EXT. OPPOSITE RIVERBANK - NIGHT

[[Scene 32: Low-angle shot, ambient moonlight]]

They reach the riverbank. Pull the boat onto the sand. Jake signals Sung-ho to stay low.

Jake jumps out first. Crouches. Listens.

JAKE
(barely audible)
Wait.

SUNG-HO freezes. Ten seconds. Twenty.

A car passes on the road above. Headlights sweep. Gone.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(gesturing)
Now. Stay in the shadows.

They drag the boat into the reeds. Move toward the treeline.

SUNG-HO
(whispering)
Which way?

Jake points. They move.

EXT. ROADSIDE - NIGHT

[[Scene 33: Tracking shot from behind, streetlight pattern]]

Jake and Sung-ho move along a deserted road, keeping to the shadows. Sung-ho clutches a map.

They pause where two roads intersect.

SUNG-HO
(checking map)
Left here. Half kilometer.

JAKE
You're sure?

SUNG-HO
(folding the map)
I'm sure. I used to run deliveries in this district.
(beat)
Before I was a good man.

They continue. Jake glances back once.

JAKE
No tail.

SUNG-HO
Not yet.

EXT. INTERSECTION - INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 33A: Mr. Kim Check-in - Pressure increases, investment threatened]]

Headlights cut through the darkness. Jake and Sung-ho freeze.

A BLACK SEDAN emerges from a side street. The same sedan from the beginning. Mr. Kim's car.

It stops ten feet away. Engine running. Headlights pinning them in place.

SUNG-HO
(in Korean; subtitled)
뛰어?
*Run?*

JAKE
(low)
No. He would have already--

The rear door opens. MR. KIM steps out. Immaculate suit despite the hour. Cold eyes taking in the scene.

MR. KIM
(in English, perfect diction)
Mr. Cooper. You've been difficult to reach.

JAKE
I've been busy.

MR. KIM
(glancing at Sung-ho)
So I see. You've made new friends.

SUNG-HO
(in Korean, tense; subtitled)
제이크, 이 사람 누구야?
*Jake, who is this?*

JAKE
(in Korean; subtitled)
조용히 해.
*Stay quiet.*

Mr. Kim smiles thinly. He's heard worse Korean than Jake's.

MR. KIM
(to Jake)
Your friend should know - I'm not here to cause trouble. Just to talk.
(beat)
Walk with me.

JAKE
(not moving)
I'm comfortable here.

MR. KIM
(cold smile)
That wasn't a request.

Jake considers. Two of Mr. Kim's men have materialized from the shadows - one near the car, one behind them. Escape routes closing.

JAKE
(to Sung-ho, low)
Wait here.

SUNG-HO
Jake--

JAKE
(firm)
Wait here.

Jake steps toward Mr. Kim. They walk together, a few feet from the car. Out of earshot but in sight.

MR. KIM
You've been asking questions. Meeting with people outside the network. Visiting old contacts.

JAKE
That's my job. Intelligence gathering.

MR. KIM
(stopping)
No. Your job is what I tell you it is. Your job is following orders. Your job is delivering packages without asking what's inside.
(beat)
You've forgotten your job.

JAKE
I've been having some concerns. About the operations.

MR. KIM
(slight tilt of head)
Concerns?

JAKE
Date discrepancies. Targets that don't match the intelligence. Reports filed under my name for operations I never ran.

Mr. Kim's expression doesn't change. But something shifts behind his eyes.

MR. KIM
And you think this means what, exactly?

JAKE
I think someone's using me. Setting me up for something.

MR. KIM
(almost amused)
Using you.

He steps closer. Close enough that Jake can smell his cologne. Expensive. European.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
Mr. Cooper. I've invested considerable resources in you. Training. Cover. Protection. That investment requires returns.
(beat)
Don't make me question whether the investment was sound.

JAKE
(holding his ground)
I'm not questioning you, Mr. Kim. I'm questioning the intelligence.

MR. KIM
The intelligence comes from me. They are the same question.

A long moment. The threat clear.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
(quieter, almost gentle)
I like you, Jake. You remind me of someone I used to know. Someone who believed in things.
(beat)
But belief is dangerous. Certainty is dangerous. The only thing that keeps you alive is following orders.

JAKE
Whose orders?

MR. KIM
(stepping back)
Mine. Always mine.

He turns toward the car. Pauses.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
Your American friend. The one from the embassy. Aaron.

Jake freezes.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
(not turning around)
He speaks highly of you. Says you're dedicated. Trustworthy.
(beat)
I wonder if that trust is mutual.

He gets into the car. The window rolls down.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
Complete the mission, Mr. Cooper. The one I gave you three days ago. Prove you're still the investment I believed you to be.
(cold smile)
Or don't. And discover what happens when investments become liabilities.

The window rolls up. The car pulls away. Mr. Kim's men dissolve back into the shadows.

Jake stands alone on the dark street. Sung-ho approaches.

SUNG-HO
(Korean, worried; subtitled)
뭐라고 했어?
*What did he say?*

Jake doesn't answer. He's thinking about what Kim said.

"Your American friend."

How did Kim know about Aaron?

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(English)
Jake. What did he say?

JAKE
(finally)
He said to complete the mission.

SUNG-HO
And will you?

Jake looks at the direction the car went. Then at Sung-ho.

JAKE
I don't know whose mission it is anymore.

They start walking again. But Jake keeps looking over his shoulder now.

Something has changed.

## SEQUENCE 8 - THE SAFEHOUSE

= They reach temporary safety and plan the final confrontation.

EXT. HIDDEN SAFEHOUSE - INDUSTRIAL AREA - NIGHT

[[Scene 34: Medium shot, flickering overhead bulb]]

Jake and Sung-ho approach a nondescript building. A GUARD appears briefly from the shadows.

Jake stops. Hands visible.

JAKE
(in Korean; subtitled)
참새가 자정에 날아간다.
*The sparrow flies at midnight.*

The GUARD, 50s, weathered face, studies them.

GUARD
(gruff)
That phrase is three months out of date.

Tension. Sung-ho's hand moves toward his jacket.

GUARD (CONT'D)
(slight smile)
But close enough.

He unlocks the door. Steps aside.

GUARD (CONT'D)
Sung-ho. I heard you'd gone straight.

SUNG-HO
I heard the same about you.

GUARD
(shrugging)
We do what we can.

They enter. The door closes behind them.

INT. SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT

[[Scene 35: Wide shot, overhead yellowish light]]

A sparsely furnished room. MAPS and OLD RADIOS scattered across a table. The air smells like cigarettes and old paper.

Jake surveys the room. Sung-ho goes straight to the radios.

SUNG-HO
(examining equipment)
Half of this is junk.

GUARD
The other half works. That's more than most places can offer.

JAKE
What about weapons?

GUARD
(nodding toward a cabinet)
Two pistols. Limited ammunition. This isn't an armory.

JAKE
It'll do.

He crosses to the map table. Spreads his documents alongside the existing maps.

SUNG-HO
(to Guard)
How long can we stay?

GUARD
Until dawn. After that, I can't guarantee anything.

SUNG-HO
Understood.

The Guard moves to the door.

GUARD
I'll be outside. One knock for clear. Three for trouble.

He's gone.

INT. SAFEHOUSE - MAP TABLE - NIGHT

[[Scene 36: Over-the-shoulder shot, spotlight on map]]

Sung-ho draws a line on the map. Jake watches intently.

SUNG-HO
(tracing route)
Industrial district. Here. The building Park mentioned.

JAKE
Access points?

SUNG-HO
Main entrance. Fire escape on the east side. Rooftop access from the neighboring building.

JAKE
The rooftop. That's how we go in.

SUNG-HO
(nodding)
Less exposure. But we need to move before full light.

Jake studies the route. Something bothers him.

JAKE
If this contact is legitimate, why the rooftop? Why not just meet at street level?

SUNG-HO
Because he's careful. Like us.

JAKE
Or because it's a trap.

Beat. They look at each other.

SUNG-HO
(simple)
Maybe. But it's the only door that's open.

Jake looks at the map one more time. But his mind is elsewhere.

JAKE
(quiet)
Kim mentioned Aaron tonight.

Sung-ho looks up.

SUNG-HO
Your American friend? How would Kim know about him?

JAKE
(still staring at the map)
That's what I've been asking myself.

SUNG-HO
What did he say? Exactly.

JAKE
That Aaron "speaks highly of me." That he wonders if the trust is mutual.

Beat. Sung-ho processes this.

SUNG-HO
(careful)
Kim could be playing you. Creating distrust.

JAKE
Could be.

SUNG-HO
But?

JAKE
(finally looking up)
Aaron always shows up at the right time. The school. The bar. Outside your apartment last night. He knows things he shouldn't know. Asks questions that go a little too deep.

SUNG-HO
He's intelligence. That's what they do.

JAKE
So am I. And I don't ask questions like that.

Long pause. The weight of it settling.

SUNG-HO
(in Korean, quieter; subtitled)
그래서 어떻게 할 거야?
*So what are you going to do?*

JAKE
(switching to Korean; subtitled)
일단은 아무것도 안 해. 하지만 그를 다시 만나면...
*Nothing. For now. But when I see him again...*

He doesn't finish the thought. He doesn't have to.

SUNG-HO
(returning to English)
The contact first. Then Aaron.

Jake nods. Folds up his copy of the map.

JAKE
Then we go through it.

EXT. SAFEHOUSE - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

[[Scene 37: Medium shot from back, low-key lighting]]

Jake and Sung-ho exit through a back door. Both carry backpacks.

Jake pauses. Looks back at the safehouse.

SUNG-HO
Ready?

JAKE
(beat)
Define ready.

SUNG-HO
Breathing. Moving. Not dead yet.

JAKE
Then yeah. I'm ready.

They move into the shadows. The safehouse door closes behind them.

EXT. STREETS OF SEOUL - DAWN

[[Scene 38: Wide shot, diffused morning light with mist]]

Jake and Sung-ho walk through quiet streets. Morning mist clings to the ground. The city is just beginning to wake.

Long silence. Their footsteps echo.

SUNG-HO
(quiet)
My wife thinks I'm visiting my cousin in Busan.

JAKE
Will she forgive you?

SUNG-HO
For lying?
(beat)
She's used to it. Old habits.

JAKE
I'm sorry. For pulling you into this.

SUNG-HO
(slight smile)
You didn't pull me anywhere. I walked in with my eyes open.

They pass a street vendor setting up his cart. Normal life, starting another day.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(in Korean; subtitled)
오늘 무슨 일이 있어도 - 후회 없다.
*Whatever happens today - no regrets.*

JAKE
(in Korean; subtitled)
후회 없다.
*No regrets.*

They continue walking. The sun begins to cut through the mist.

Jake pauses. Something on the ground catches his eye.

EXT. ALLEY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 38A: Aaron Betrayal Setup - Jake discovers evidence]]

A narrow alley between two shuttered warehouses. Jake crouches, picking up a small piece of PAPER. Torn. Familiar.

SUNG-HO
(stopping)
What is it?

Jake examines the paper. Handwriting he recognizes.

JAKE
(quiet, tense)
This is Aaron's.

SUNG-HO
Aaron? Your American friend?

Jake reads what's visible on the torn fragment:

"...warehouse. Yeongdeungpo. After mid..."

The rest is torn away.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
What does it say?

JAKE
(standing slowly)
The warehouse location. The time we're supposed to meet our contact.

Sung-ho processes this.

SUNG-HO
How would he know that?

Jake's jaw tightens. He thinks back: telling Aaron about the industrial district. Mentioning the warehouse. After midnight.

JAKE
Because I told him. Last night. Outside your apartment.

SUNG-HO
(alarmed)
You told him? Why would you--

JAKE
He said he wanted to help. Said if something went wrong, he'd send backup.
(bitter)
I was stupid.

Jake looks around the alley. More scraps of paper. Boot prints in the dust. Recent.

JAKE (CONT'D)
Someone was here. Meeting. This must have blown loose.

He picks up another fragment. Different handwriting - Korean this time. A timestamp: 0300.

SUNG-HO
(reading over his shoulder)
Three in the morning. That's two hours ago.

JAKE
Someone left this alley with information about our meet. Our route.

He pulls out the "emergency beacon" Aaron gave him. Examines it with new eyes.

JAKE (CONT'D)
He gave me this. Said it was a distress beacon. Embassy frequency.

SUNG-HO
(suspicious)
You believed that?

JAKE
(grim)
I wanted to.

He turns the device over. Finds a small seam. Uses his thumbnail to pry it open.

Inside: standard electronics. But also something else. A small TRANSMITTER. Active. Blinking.

SUNG-HO
(in Korean; subtitled)
젠장.
*Shit.*

JAKE
He's been tracking us. The whole time.

He pulls out the transmitter component. Crushes it under his heel. Drops the remains in the gutter.

SUNG-HO
The rooftop meet. If he knows--

JAKE
Then they'll be waiting. Or they'll intercept the contact before we get there.

SUNG-HO
We should abort.

Jake considers. Then shakes his head.

JAKE
No. If Aaron's been reporting to someone, they already know everything I know. Running doesn't help.
(beat)
But now I know something they don't.

SUNG-HO
What's that?

JAKE
(cold)
That Aaron Mitchell isn't my friend. He's never been my friend.

He starts walking again. Faster now. Purpose sharpening.

SUNG-HO
(catching up)
And when this is over? What happens to him?

Jake doesn't answer. His face is hard.

But we know what he's thinking.

## SEQUENCE 9 - THE ROOFTOP DEAL

= The deal is made, but tensions rise.

EXT. INDUSTRIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP - DAWN

[[Scene 39: Medium low-angle shot, golden hour lighting]]

Jake and Sung-ho arrive at a rooftop. An UNKNOWN MAN, Korean, 50s, stands by equipment laid out on a tarp - radio transmitter, documents, a small case.

The Unknown Man doesn't turn around.

UNKNOWN MAN
(in Korean; subtitled)
늦었네.
*You're late.*

SUNG-HO
(in Korean; subtitled)
조심했어요.
*We were careful.*

UNKNOWN MAN
(turning)
Careful would have been not coming at all.

He looks at Jake. Studies him.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
(switching to English)
The American. You're younger than I expected.

JAKE
Does that matter?

UNKNOWN MAN
Age is experience. Experience is survival. You've survived two years in Kim's network without knowing what you were doing.
(beat)
That's either very lucky or very stupid.

JAKE
Which do you think?

UNKNOWN MAN
(slight smile)
I think you're about to find out.

He gestures toward the equipment.

EXT. INDUSTRIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 40: Over-the-shoulder shot, warm early morning light]]

The Unknown Man hands Jake a RADIO TRANSMITTER and a piece of paper.

UNKNOWN MAN
Embassy frequency. Secure channel. They'll be monitoring from 0600.

Jake examines the transmitter.

JAKE
How do I know this isn't a trap?

UNKNOWN MAN
You don't.

SUNG-HO
(translating from the paper)
Call signs. Verification codes.
(to Unknown Man)
Where did you get these?

UNKNOWN MAN
From the same place I get everything. People who want Kim gone.

JAKE
Why? What's your stake in this?

UNKNOWN MAN
(flat)
Kim killed my brother. Nineteen eighty-seven. Made it look like a car accident.

Beat. The honesty of it catches Jake off guard.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
Is that enough motivation for you?

Jake pockets the transmitter. Folds the paper.

JAKE
It'll do.

EXT. INDUSTRIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 41: Medium close-up, bright morning light]]

Jake steps toward the Unknown Man. Aggressive.

JAKE
One thing I don't understand.

UNKNOWN MAN
Just one?

JAKE
If you have all this - the frequencies, the codes, the intel on Kim - why not go to the embassy yourself? Why do you need me?

UNKNOWN MAN
(cool)
Because you're the proof.

JAKE
What does that mean?

UNKNOWN MAN
Documents can be forged. Intelligence can be manufactured. But an American who was inside Kim's network for two years? Who can describe the operations, the contacts, the methods?
(beat)
That's evidence that walks and talks.

JAKE
(stepping closer)
You're using me.

UNKNOWN MAN
Everyone uses everyone. The question is whether the using serves a purpose you believe in.

Jake's jaw tightens. Sung-ho steps between them.

SUNG-HO
(firm)
Jake. We have what we came for.

JAKE
(to Unknown Man, hard)
If this is a setup - if any of this is wrong - I will find you.

UNKNOWN MAN
(unmoved)
I'm counting on it. Now go. Before Kim's people sweep this district.

EXT. INDUSTRIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP - STAIRWELL - DAWN

[[Scene 42: Tracking side shot, long shadows]]

Jake and Sung-ho reach the stairwell. Jake pulls the door open.

SUNG-HO
(low)
You trust him?

JAKE
I trust the hate in his eyes when he talked about Kim.

They start to descend. Jake freezes.

AARON MITCHELL climbs toward them. Red-faced. Out of breath.

AARON
(gasping)
Jake! Thank God--

Jake's hand moves to his jacket.

JAKE
(cold)
How did you find us?

AARON
Embassy frequency. Your contact used an old encryption--

JAKE
Show me your notebook.

AARON
What?

JAKE
The notebook you write everything in.

A long beat. Aaron's nervous energy stills.

AARON
(different voice - harder)
That's not how this works, Jake.

SUNG-HO
(in Korean, warning; subtitled)
제이크, 조심해.
*Jake, be careful.*

JAKE
You've been reporting on me. Since the beginning.

AARON
(not denying it)
I've been doing my job. Same as you thought you were doing.

JAKE
Your job for who?

AARON
(urgent)
Kim's people are sweeping this district. They know about the meet.

JAKE
How do they know?

AARON
Because I told them. Two hours ago. Before I realized what was on those documents.

JAKE
You--

AARON
Kim played me too. I thought I was passing to South Korean intelligence. Off-books but still our side. I didn't know it was going to Pyongyang until three days ago.

SUNG-HO
(skeptical)
Convenient.

AARON
Those documents have my name too. If Kim goes down, I go down with him. I'm not here to save my cover. We both need to get out of Seoul alive.

Distant SIRENS.

SUNG-HO
(urgent)
We need to move.

JAKE
(to Aaron, cold)
You're coming with us. When this is over, you tell me everything.

AARON
Fair enough.

JAKE
And if you're lying--

AARON
(meeting his eyes)
Then you can kill me yourself.

JAKE
Move.

They descend. Aaron follows.

EXT. NARROW ALLEY - DAWN

[[Scene 43: Medium side shot, natural morning light]]

Jake stops in the alley. Turns to Sung-ho.

JAKE
We should split up.

SUNG-HO
(immediate)
No.

JAKE
Two targets are easier to track than one. If Kim's people are watching--

SUNG-HO
Then we face them together.

JAKE
That's not smart.

SUNG-HO
(stubborn)
Smart would have been staying home. I'm past smart.

Beat. Jake's expression softens.

JAKE
If something happens to me, you need to get this to the embassy.
(holding up the transmitter)
You know enough to explain it.

SUNG-HO
And if something happens to you, who explains you?

Jake doesn't have an answer.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(quieter)
I'm not leaving you, Jake. Not now.

Long pause. Jake looks down the alley. Back at Sung-ho.

JAKE
Okay. Together. But if I say run, you run.

SUNG-HO
(in Korean; subtitled)
두고 보자.
*We'll see.*

EXT. END OF ALLEY - DAWN

[[Scene 44: Wide shot from behind, soft morning light]]

They reach the end of the alley. The city opens up before them - early morning traffic, people starting their day.

Jake stops. Turns to Sung-ho.

JAKE
Hyung.

Sung-ho looks at him.

JAKE (CONT'D)
Whatever happens after today... thank you. For believing me. When I didn't deserve it.

SUNG-HO
(simple)
You deserved it.

JAKE
I was working for the enemy.

SUNG-HO
You didn't know. The man I know - the one who saved my sister, who sits on my floor drinking soju and talking about nothing - that man is good.
(beat)
The rest is just... noise.

Jake absorbs this. Nods slowly.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(lighter)
Now. Are we going to stand here being emotional, or are we going to finish this?

JAKE
(almost smiling)
Let's finish it.

They clasp hands briefly. Not an embrace - too public, too exposed. But meaningful.

Then they step into the light. Two men walking toward whatever comes next.

# ACT THREE

## SEQUENCE 10 - THE INTELLIGENCE

= Jake receives critical information that changes everything.

EXT. DOWNTOWN ALLEY - NIGHT

[[Scene 45: Close-up on hands, low ambient light]]

Jake moves cautiously into the narrow alley. A HOODED FIGURE waits in shadow, back against damp brick.

Jake stops ten feet away. Hand near his jacket.

JAKE
(flat)
You're late.

HOODED FIGURE
(voice low, neutral)
I'm here. That's what matters.

The Figure extends a gloved hand. A small USB DRIVE between two fingers.

HOODED FIGURE (CONT'D)
Everything's on this. Names. Accounts. The whole network.

JAKE
Why?

HOODED FIGURE
Because someone should know the truth before it's too late.

Jake doesn't move to take it.

JAKE
Who are you?

HOODED FIGURE
(slight pause)
Someone who made the same mistake you did.

Jake studies the shadowed face. Sees nothing useful.

HOODED FIGURE (CONT'D)
Take it. Don't plug it in anywhere they can trace. And Cooper--

Jake reaches out. Takes the drive.

HOODED FIGURE (CONT'D)
Trust no one. Especially the people you think you know.

The Figure steps back into deeper shadow.

JAKE
Wait--

But the alley is empty. Just Jake, the drive, and the distant sound of traffic.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(under breath)
Great.

INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

[[Scene 46: Medium shot, blue computer glow]]

Jake sits at his desk. The USB drive plugged into a battered laptop. Screen glow illuminates his face.

Lines of data scroll. Names. Dates. Financial transfers.

JAKE
(muttering, reading)
Kim... Park... Yoo...

He clicks through files. His expression shifts from concentration to confusion.

JAKE (CONT'D)
These are Agency accounts. How did they--

More clicking. More data.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(growing horror)
No. No, that's not right.

A photograph loads. Agent Yoo - the same face from the warehouse briefcase. Next to it, a transfer record. Jake's code name.

JAKE (CONT'D)
I didn't authorize that. I never--

Another file. Another dead agent. Another transfer bearing his signature.

Jake pushes back from the desk. Runs his hands through his hair.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(barely audible)
Oh God.

He looks at the screen. The evidence is undeniable.

JAKE (CONT'D)
They used me. Every single time.

His hands are shaking. He reaches for the keyboard to scroll further--

INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 47: Close-up on face, dimming screen light]]

A sound from the hallway. Footsteps. Multiple.

Jake freezes. His eyes cut to the door.

JAKE
(whispered)
No.

The footsteps stop outside his apartment. A shadow passes under the door.

Jake is already moving. Grabbing the USB drive. Shoving the laptop into his backpack.

MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.)
(Korean; subtitled)
여기야. 가.
*This is the one. Go.*

Jake doesn't hesitate.

EXT. JAKE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

[[Scene 48: Wide shot from street, streetlight and moonlight]]

Jake climbs out the window, backpack over shoulder. He lowers himself onto the fire escape, metal groaning under his weight.

JAKE
(hissed curse)
Damn it.

Above him, his apartment door CRASHES open. Shouts in Korean.

Jake descends fast. Too fast. His foot slips on a wet rung.

He catches himself. Keeps going.

Below: the alley. Above: flashlight beams sweeping through his window.

He drops the last eight feet. Lands hard. Runs.

EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

[[Scene 49: Side tracking shot, moonlight]]

Jake sprints across connected rooftops. Seoul spreads below - a sea of lights and shadows.

He reaches a gap between buildings. Six feet. Maybe seven.

Doesn't slow down.

JAKE
(under breath)
Don't think. Just go.

He jumps. Arms windmilling.

Lands on the far edge. Staggers. Catches himself on a ventilation unit.

Behind him, distant shouts. Flashlights bobbing on the rooftops.

Jake keeps running. Into the dark.

EXT. ROOFTOP - WATER TOWER - LATER

[[Scene 49A: Aaron Confrontation - Partial truth revealed, major scene]]

Jake crouches in the shadow of a water tower.

AARON (O.S.)
(low)
Jake.

Jake spins, weapon raised. Aaron emerges from behind an air conditioning unit, hands visible.

JAKE
(sharp whisper)
How did you find me?

AARON
(flat, no affect)
I know how you move. Where you go when you're scared. Two years.

Jake's jaw tightens. This isn't the Aaron he knew.

JAKE
Then talk. Who do you actually work for?

AARON
That's the thing, Jake. I stopped knowing six months ago. Maybe longer.

JAKE
Try.

AARON
Embassy cover, like I said. But there was a secondary approach - a Korean businessman. Said he represented South Korean interests. Parallel channel. Off-books intelligence sharing.
(beat)
I believed I was still serving my country.

JAKE
(hard)
Same as me.

AARON
(looking away)
Three days ago, I saw a name on a report. An asset I helped identify. South Korean intelligence. Dead now because of me.

JAKE
Agent Yoo.

Aaron nods.

JAKE (CONT'D)
The date. March third. I was in the hospital.

AARON
And I was delivering a package in Itaewon. Same mission code. They ran parallel operations - both of us feeding the same beast without knowing it.

JAKE
Kim.

AARON
Kim's network. You thought CIA. I thought South Korean intel. Neither of us knew we were working for Pyongyang.

JAKE
Agent Yoo. The others. That's on you.

AARON
(too quiet)
His daughter's name is Min-ji. She likes strawberry milk and her father's old watch. The one he let her wear on Sundays.

Jake stares at him.

AARON (CONT'D)
(voice hollow)
I found that out after. I looked her up. Needed to know who I...

He can't finish the sentence.

AARON (CONT'D)
Guilt is useless. I know. But it's all I've got until we burn this down.

JAKE
And what do you want to do?

AARON
Burn it down. Every contact, every handler, every dead drop. Give it all to the real embassy.

JAKE
Why should I trust you?

AARON
(simple)
If I was still working for Kim, his people would be here already. Kim doesn't do patient.

Jake considers. Then:

JAKE
The factory on Yeongdeungpo. We're regrouping.

AARON
I know things about Kim's network that aren't in any file. Every name. Every dead drop.
(beat)
And if you still want to kill me after, I'll understand.

Jake starts toward the fire escape.

AARON (CONT'D)
(quiet)
That night at the bar. When I said you reminded me of someone.

Jake pauses. Doesn't turn.

AARON (CONT'D)
I was talking about myself. Before all this. Before I stopped being able to look in mirrors.

JAKE
(not turning)
That version of you is dead.

AARON
I know.

(beat)

So is yours.

He descends. Aaron follows.

## SEQUENCE 11 - THE FINAL PLAN

= Jake and Sung-ho reunite and prepare for the final confrontation.

INT. OLD ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

[[Scene 50: Medium shot, dim industrial lighting]]

Jake slips through a broken side door. Pauses. Listens.

Movement in the shadows. Jake's hand goes to his waistband.

SUNG-HO (O.S.)
(Korean, low)
It's me.

Jake exhales. Sung-ho steps into dim light, face drawn with worry.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(switching to English)
I heard sirens near your building. I thought--

He stops. Sees Aaron stepping through the door behind Jake.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(sharp, switching to Korean; subtitled)
뭐야 이거? 왜 여기 데리고 왔어?
*What is this? Why did you bring him here?*

JAKE
(in Korean; subtitled)
긴 얘기야. 나중에 설명할게.
*Long story. I'll explain later.*

SUNG-HO
(not moving, eyes on Aaron)
Explain now.

Jake looks between them. Aaron stands awkwardly, hands visible.

JAKE
(English)
He knows things. About Kim's network. Things that could help us.

SUNG-HO
(bitter)
He also knows where this safehouse is. Now.

AARON
(quiet)
If I wanted to burn you, I would have done it hours ago.

SUNG-HO
(to Jake)
You trust this?

JAKE
(honest)
No. But I don't have to trust him. I just have to use him.

Aaron flinches at that. Accepts it.

SUNG-HO
(long pause, then in Korean; subtitled)
네 결정이야. 하지만 그가 나를 배신하면, 네가 죽이기 전에 내가 먼저 죽인다.
*Your call. But if he betrays us, I kill him before you do.*

JAKE
(in Korean; subtitled)
줄 서.
*Get in line.*

Aaron watches the exchange. Doesn't understand every word, but gets the meaning.

AARON
(to Sung-ho)
I know you don't trust me. I wouldn't either.
(beat)
But I have names. Contacts. Dead drops. I can give you Kim's entire network.

SUNG-HO
(cold)
And why should we believe anything you say?

AARON
Because if Kim's network survives this, I'm dead anyway. We all are.
(simple)
I'm not asking you to like me. I'm asking you to let me help.

Long beat. Sung-ho looks at Jake. Jake nods slightly.

SUNG-HO
(finally)
One wrong move. One lie. One hesitation.
(in Korean, pointed; subtitled)
그리고 네 미국인 친구는 여기 남는다. 영원히.
*And your American friend stays here. Forever.*

AARON
(understanding the threat if not the words)
Fair enough.

Sung-ho gestures toward the factory interior. His expression doesn't soften.

SUNG-HO
This way. We have work to do.

INT. OLD ABANDONED FACTORY - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 51: Wide shot, yellowish glow]]

A bare concrete floor. A single work light. Maps spread out. Radio equipment. A concealed weapon laid beside a worn backpack.

Jake and Sung-ho sit cross-legged, sorting through their gear. Aaron sits apart from them, near the wall - close enough to participate, far enough to not be trusted.

SUNG-HO
(checking items)
Transmitter. Backup battery. Maps of the district.

JAKE
The USB has everything. Kim's network. Money trails. Names of agents he turned.

SUNG-HO
(pause)
Including yours?

Jake doesn't answer. That's answer enough.

AARON
(quietly)
And mine.

Sung-ho shoots him a look.

SUNG-HO
You want a medal?

AARON
(shaking head)
I want to help. If you'll let me.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
So what's the play?

JAKE
We need to reach someone outside Kim's network. Real CIA. Real embassy contacts.

SUNG-HO
How do we know who's real?

AARON
(leaning forward)
I can tell you. Three names at the embassy who definitely aren't compromised.
(beat)
Miller in the RSO office. Thompson in communications. And there's a woman - Patterson - who handles counterintelligence. She's been investigating Kim's network for months. Independently.

JAKE
(suspicious)
How do you know they're clean?

AARON
(flat)
Because Kim tried to recruit them. Through me. They all said no.
(beat)
That's when I started realizing something was wrong.

SUNG-HO
(to Jake, Korean; subtitled)
믿어?
*You believe this?*

JAKE
(Korean; subtitled)
확인할 수 있어.
*We can verify.*

JAKE
(English, to Aaron)
Give me the frequency Patterson uses. The secure one.

Aaron hesitates.

AARON
If I give you that, she'll know someone burned her communications.

JAKE
That's her problem. Give me the frequency.

Aaron considers. Then reaches into his pocket. Pulls out a small slip of paper. Slides it across the floor toward Jake.

AARON
31.4 MHz. She monitors it between 0600 and 0800. Uses a modified encryption that--

JAKE
(cutting him off)
That's enough.

He takes the paper. Pockets it.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(bitter)
Good question.

Sung-ho adjusts the transmitter. Tests a frequency.

SUNG-HO
There's an emergency signal. Old frequency my unit used. If anyone's listening...

JAKE
If.

SUNG-HO
(shrug)
Better than nothing.

Jake looks at the equipment. Then at Sung-ho.

JAKE
You don't have to be part of this. What's on that drive - it's enough to get us both killed.

SUNG-HO
(matter-of-fact)
Already crossed that line. Might as well see it through.

JAKE
Why?

SUNG-HO
(simple)
Because you'd do the same for me.

Jake holds his gaze. Nods once.

JAKE
Dawn. We send the signal at dawn.

EXT. FACTORY ROOFTOP - DAWN

[[Scene 52: Low-angle shot from behind, city skyline]]

First light touches Seoul's skyline. Jake stands on the rooftop edge, transmitter in hand.

He extends the antenna. Adjusts the dial.

JAKE
(to himself)
Come on. Someone be listening.

He pushes the button. Three short pulses. Pause. Three more.

Holds his breath.

The city sprawls silent below. No response.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(quieter)
Please.

He waits. The transmitter is warm in his cold hands.

EXT. FACTORY ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 53: Close-up on face, dawn light and distant flashing]]

Jake squints at the horizon. Nothing.

Then--

A LIGHT. Distant. Flashing. Three short. Pause. Three short.

Jake's breath catches.

JAKE
(barely audible)
They heard us.

He watches the light repeat. Confirmation. Someone is out there.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(stronger now)
We're not alone.

He lowers the transmitter. Looks at the rising sun.

For the first time in days, something like hope crosses his face.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(to himself)
Time to finish this.

INT. OLD ABANDONED FACTORY - DAWN

[[Scene 54: Medium side shot, dim and ambient light]]

Jake comes down the stairs quickly. Sung-ho looks up from the equipment, tense.

SUNG-HO
(Korean; subtitled)
어떻게 됐어?
*Well?*

JAKE
(nodding)
They responded. We have backup.

Sung-ho exhales. Allows himself a small smile.

SUNG-HO
How long?

JAKE
Don't know. But they're coming.

SUNG-HO
Then we need to move. Kim's people will figure out where that signal came from.

Jake crosses to the gear. Starts packing efficiently.

JAKE
The warehouse three blocks east. We set up there. Draw them in.

SUNG-HO
(pause)
You want to use ourselves as bait.

JAKE
I want to end this. Today.

Sung-ho considers. Then nods.

SUNG-HO
(gathering his pack)
Okay. Your plan.

They shoulder their bags. Check weapons.

JAKE
Ready?

SUNG-HO
(dark humor)
No. Let's go anyway.

They head for the exit.

## SEQUENCE 12 - THE TRAP

= The final confrontation.

INT. NEARBY ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAWN

[[Scene 55: Over-the-shoulder shot, dusty morning sun]]

Dusty morning light filters through broken skylights. Jake kneels by a support beam, adjusting wires connected to a makeshift trigger mechanism.

Sung-ho stands by the doorway, watching the street.

JAKE
(focused, low)
How's the street?

SUNG-HO
Quiet. For now.

Jake twists two wires together. Tests the connection.

JAKE
When they come through that door, these beams come down. Blocks the exit.

SUNG-HO
And if they come through another way?

JAKE
(glancing at him)
Then we improvise.

Sung-ho moves to a better vantage point. Checks his weapon.

SUNG-HO
How many you think?

JAKE
Kim won't send an army. Too visible. Four, maybe five.

SUNG-HO
We can handle five.

JAKE
(finishing the wires)
We have to.

He stands. Surveys the trap. The beams rigged above the entrance. The exit routes mapped in his head.

JAKE (CONT'D)
Stay low until I trigger it. Then we move fast.

SUNG-HO
(nodding)
Fast. I know fast.

They exchange a look. No more words needed.

Jake moves to his position behind stacked crates. Waits.

EXT. WAREHOUSE EXTERIOR - DAWN

[[Scene 56: Wide low-angle shot, soft morning light]]

Two MEN IN DARK SUITS move through the morning mist. Professional. Weapons drawn but lowered.

They approach the warehouse cautiously. Scanning windows. Checking corners.

INT. NEARBY ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 56A: Interior perspective - Sung-ho spots the approach]]

Sung-ho crouches behind crates near the side entrance. Peers through a gap.

He sees them. Raises two fingers to Jake.

Jake nods. Ready.

EXT. WAREHOUSE EXTERIOR - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 56B: Exterior - Pursuers split and converge]]

The lead man signals. They split. One toward the main door. One toward the side.

LEAD MAN
(low, Korean; subtitled)
셋에.
*On three.*

INT. NEARBY ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 56C: Interior - The moment before the trap springs]]

Sung-ho catches Jake's eye. Mouths: "They're here."

Jake's hand moves to the trigger wire.

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 57: High-angle shot, harsh shadows]]

The main door CRASHES open. First pursuer enters fast, weapon sweeping.

PURSUER #1
(Korean; subtitled)
구석 확인해! 움직여!
*Clear the corners! Move!*

The second man enters behind him.

Jake pulls the trigger wire.

METAL GROANS. The rigged beams CRASH down behind the pursuers, blocking their exit. Dust explodes into the air.

PURSUER #2
(Korean, shouting; subtitled)
함정이야! 함정이야!
*Trap! It's a trap!*

Chaos. The men dive for cover, disoriented.

Jake emerges from behind the crates. Gun trained.

JAKE
(sharp)
Don't move!

Pursuer #1 spins toward the voice. Jake fires once - the shot sparks off concrete near the man's feet.

JAKE (CONT'D)
I said don't move!

SUNG-HO
(emerging, weapon ready)
Drop them! Now!

The pursuers freeze. Assess. Two against two, but Jake and Sung-ho have position.

PURSUER #1
(switching to English)
You're making a mistake, Cooper.

JAKE
Weapons. On the ground.

A tense moment. Then both pursuers lower their guns. Set them down.

JAKE (CONT'D)
Kick them away.

They comply. Metal scrapes across concrete.

Jake moves forward, keeping his gun steady. Sung-ho covers from the flank.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(to Pursuer #1)
Who else is coming?

PURSUER #1
(cold smile)
Everyone.

Behind them, the blocked door SHUDDERS. Someone trying to get through.

SUNG-HO
(urgent)
Jake. We don't have long.

Jake grabs Pursuer #1 by the collar. Shoves him against a crate.

JAKE
Then talk fast.

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 58: Medium close-up, diffused natural light]]

Jake grabs the LEAD PURSUER by the collar. Slams him against a crate.

JAKE
Who sent you? Was it Kim? The Agency?

The pursuer - we'll call him AGENT PARK - LAUGHS. Blood on his teeth.

AGENT PARK
(in Korean; subtitled)
아직도 이해 못 하는 거야?
*You still don't understand, do you?*

JAKE
English. Now.

AGENT PARK
(switching, amused)
Your Korean is better than mine. But okay, Mr. Cooper. English it is.

He looks at Jake with something like pity.

AGENT PARK (CONT'D)
You want to know who sent us? Everyone did. That's the joke.

SUNG-HO
(weapon trained)
Jake. We don't have time for this.

JAKE
(ignoring him, to Agent Park)
Explain.

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 59: ALL IS LOST - Close-up on Jake, half-lit face]]

Agent Park leans back against the crate. Blood on his teeth. Almost relieved to be caught.

AGENT PARK
You want to know who sent us? Everyone--

MR. KIM (O.S.)
I did.

Jake spins. The voice comes from the shadows near the back of the warehouse. Footsteps. Deliberate. Unhurried.

MR. KIM emerges into the dusty light. Same severe face. Same cold eyes. Same perfect diction. The black sedan from Scene 7 - the same man who recruited Jake in the alley - now here to unmake him.

Agent Park's demeanor changes instantly. Fear. He's afraid of Kim too.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
Hello, Jake. We need to talk about who you really are.

JAKE
(gun rising)
Don't move.

MR. KIM
(to Agent Park, ignoring Jake)
Leave us.

Agent Park hesitates. Looks at Jake's gun. Looks at Kim.

AGENT PARK
Sir, he's--

MR. KIM
(sharp, cutting)
Now.

Agent Park scrambles to his feet. Moves toward the side exit. Doesn't look back.

SUNG-HO
(weapon trained on Kim)
Jake. Who is this?

MR. KIM
(eyes never leaving Jake)
I'm the architect. He's my finest work.

Sung-ho looks to Jake for explanation. Jake's face is ashen.

JAKE
(to Sung-ho)
Go. Wait outside.

SUNG-HO
I'm not leaving you with--

JAKE
(harder)
Go.

Beat. Sung-ho reads something in Jake's eyes. Reluctantly, he backs toward the door. Keeps his weapon ready.

The door closes. Jake and Mr. Kim. Alone.

Silence. Dust motes drift in the morning light.

MR. KIM
You've been busy. The documents. Mr. Han. The warehouse deals. Impressive, really. You learned well.

JAKE
From you.

MR. KIM
Yes. From me.

He moves slowly. Circling. Not threatening - assessing. Like a sculptor examining his work.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
Tell me, Jake. Your handler at Langley. Describe him to me. His voice. His manner. The way he ends calls.

Jake opens his mouth. Closes it.

He's never met the man. Never video called. Just... voices. Coded messages. Dead drops.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
(nodding, almost gentle)
Because there is no handler. There never was. Every instruction, every drop point, every coded message - routed through my network.

JAKE
That's not--

MR. KIM
You've been working for Pyongyang since the day you arrived in Seoul.

The words hit like a physical blow. Jake staggers back.

JAKE
I was vetted. Trained at the Farm. I have a service record--

MR. KIM
All of it manufactured. Intermediaries. Cutouts. A paper trail designed by people who've been doing this longer than you've been alive.

He stops circling. Faces Jake directly.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
Your idealism was... perfect. You believed so completely. That belief made you invisible to everyone looking for doubt.

(beat, almost proud)

You were my masterpiece.

Jake's gun hand trembles. The weapon feels impossibly heavy.

JAKE
The missions. The intelligence I gathered--

MR. KIM
Went north. Every time. The packages you delivered helped identify South Korean agents. Four of them are dead because of information you provided.

JAKE
(barely audible)
No.

MR. KIM
Agent Yoo. A daughter, eight years old. Park Jong-woo. A father of two. Kim Sun-hee. Thirty-one years old. Lee Hyun-ki. He was engaged.

Jake's legs give out. He catches himself on a crate. The gun clatters to the floor.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
The worst part isn't that you helped kill them. The worst part is that you felt proud doing it. Every mission, every dead drop, every night pretending to be a hero - you thought you were saving your country.

He crouches down. Eye level with Jake. His voice drops. Almost intimate.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
I made you, Jake. Every belief, every mission, every moment of pride - I designed it. The CIA cover wasn't a cover. It was the lie I built you around.

JAKE
(barely a whisper)
Then who am I?

MR. KIM
(almost tender)
That's what I love about you. Even now, you think there's an answer.

He straightens his jacket. The gesture is casual. Devastating.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
The teacher who cared about his students? I needed you to seem kind. The patriot who believed in his mission? I needed you to never question. The man who wanted to matter?

(beat, leaning close)

I invented him. Every noble impulse, every moment you felt proud - I put it there. You're not Jake Cooper. You're a story I told.

Jake stares at the ground. His whole world - collapsed. Every sacrifice. Every choice. Every moment of meaning.

A lie.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
(standing, brushing dust from his sleeve)
Dawn. That's how long you have. Come back to me - I'll give you something new to believe in. Another story. A better one, maybe.

He moves toward the door. Pauses.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
Or stay here. Crawl into that embassy. Confess everything. Spend the rest of your life in a room answering questions.

(turning back, almost curious)

But you should know - the part of you that wants to do the right thing? The voice telling you to turn yourself in? I put that there too. Even your conscience is my design.

He leaves. The door closes with a hollow echo.

Jake sits in the dust and broken light. Utterly alone.

The teacher. The spy. The patriot.

All masks. And underneath - nothing. No one. A void where a person used to be.

## SEQUENCE 13 - DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL

= Jake's complete psychological collapse, extended through the night. The hardest hours before dawn.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - BACK ALLEY - DAWN

[[Scene 60: Dark Night of Soul - Extended emotional collapse]]

Jake stumbles through the back door. His movements are mechanical. Broken.

Sung-ho rushes to him.

SUNG-HO
(in Korean; subtitled)
제이크! 거기서 무슨 일이 있었어?
*Jake! What happened in there?*

Jake doesn't answer. Can't answer. He makes it three steps, then his body betrays him.

He doubles over. VOMITS. Violent, wrenching heaves. Everything coming up. The coffee from this morning. Last night's rice. Everything.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(alarmed, reaching for him)
Jake--

Jake waves him off. Staggers to the wall. Slides down it until he's sitting in the grime.

His hands are shaking. Not just trembling - spasming. He stares at them like they belong to someone else.

JAKE
(barely a whisper)
I'm not... I was never...

He can't finish. The words won't come.

Sung-ho crouches beside him. Waits. Doesn't push.

Minutes pass. Jake's breathing is ragged. Hyperventilating. Then forcing himself to slow down. Then hyperventilating again.

SUNG-HO
(quiet, steady)
Whatever it is. Whatever he told you. You're still here. I'm still here.

JAKE
(hollow laugh that's more like a sob)
I'm not here. I was never here. Jake Cooper doesn't exist.

SUNG-HO
You're sitting in an alley. I can see you. You exist.

JAKE
(turning to face him, eyes wild)
Everything I've done. Every mission. Every risk you took helping me. The people who died because of--

He can't finish. Vomits again. Dry heaves this time. Nothing left.

SUNG-HO
(waiting until it passes)
Tell me. All of it.

Jake wipes his mouth with a shaking hand.

JAKE
I thought I was CIA. Deep cover. Serving my country.

(beat)

I was working for the North. The whole time. Mr. Kim - my handler - he's North Korean intelligence. Every "mission" I ran helped identify South Korean agents. Four of them are dead. Because of me.

Sung-ho goes very still.

SUNG-HO
(careful)
Did you know?

JAKE
(anguished)
No. But does that matter? Does it--

He breaks down. Sobbing. Not crying - sobbing. Deep, ugly, wrenching sounds that come from somewhere primal.

Sung-ho doesn't move. Doesn't speak. Just stays beside him.

The morning light creeps slowly up the alley wall.

EXT. BACK ALLEY - LATER

[[Scene 60-II: Daylight returns - Jake's silent vigil]]

Hours have passed. The sun is higher. The sounds of Seoul waking up - traffic, voices, the rumble of construction.

Jake hasn't moved from the wall. He's stopped crying. Now he just stares at nothing.

Sung-ho sits beside him. Silent sentinel.

SUNG-HO
(finally)
When I was in the army. There was a man in my unit. Good soldier. Followed orders perfectly.

Jake doesn't respond. Sung-ho continues anyway.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
One day we found out the orders he'd been following - the intelligence reports he'd delivered - they were wrong. Someone up the chain had been compromised. Our unit walked into an ambush because of information he provided.

(beat)

Three men died. He never knew the intelligence was bad. He thought he was doing his duty.

JAKE
(dead voice)
What happened to him?

SUNG-HO
He killed himself. Couldn't live with it.

(pause)

I think about him sometimes. Whether it was the right choice.

Jake looks at him for the first time in hours.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
It wasn't. Because he let the people who actually did this - the ones who corrupted the intelligence, who set the trap - they got away with it. His death didn't save anyone. It just gave them one more victim.

Jake looks back at the ground.

JAKE
I don't know how to live with this.

SUNG-HO
I know. But you have to try.

The sun climbs higher. Neither man moves.

EXT. BACK ALLEY - EVENING

[[Scene 60-III: Dusk settles - Sung-ho keeps watch]]

The light has changed. Shadows lengthening. Day bleeding into night.

Sung-ho has found a blanket from somewhere. Draped it over Jake's shoulders. Brought water that sits untouched beside them.

SUNG-HO
You should eat something.

Jake doesn't respond.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
Or at least drink the water.

Nothing.

Sung-ho settles back against the wall. Pulls out a cigarette. Lights it.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
I'm not leaving, so you might as well talk to me.

JAKE
(after a long pause)
Why are you still here?

SUNG-HO
(simply)
Where else would I be?

JAKE
I'm a North Korean asset. Everything you did to help me - you were helping them. Pyongyang.

SUNG-HO
I know. You told me.

JAKE
Then why--

SUNG-HO
When you asked me for help. Did you know?

Silence.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
Then you were lied to. Same as me. The difference is, you have to live with what you did while being lied to. I just have to live with being your friend.

JAKE
(bitter)
That's a difference?

SUNG-HO
Yes.

(beat)

Because you can choose what happens next. They can't take that. Whatever they made you - this moment, what you do now - that belongs to you.

Jake pulls the blanket tighter. Shivers despite the warmth.

JAKE
I keep thinking about running. Getting on a plane. Going somewhere no one knows me. Start over.

SUNG-HO
You could.

JAKE
But I'd still be me. Still be... this.

(beat)

There's no starting over when you're built on a lie.

Sung-ho takes a long drag on his cigarette.

SUNG-HO
Or maybe you burn it down. And find out what's underneath.

JAKE
What if there's nothing? What if I'm just... hollow? A shell they filled up with lies?

Sung-ho takes a long drag. Exhales slowly.

SUNG-HO
You remember Park Min-jun? The kid who couldn't spell his own name?

JAKE
(confused)
What does that--

SUNG-HO
You stayed late with him. Every day for three weeks. Made up games. Drew pictures. Your handler didn't tell you to do that. Pyongyang didn't send a memo saying "teach this kid to write."

(beat)

You did it because you wanted to. Because you saw a child struggling and you couldn't walk away.

JAKE
(barely audible)
That's not enough.

SUNG-HO
It's a start.

He stubs out his cigarette. His voice drops.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
A weapon doesn't sit in an alley crying. A tool doesn't feel sick when it learns what it was used for. You're broken, Jake. Completely shattered.

(beat)

But only real things can break.

Night settles fully. Seoul's neon glow begins to bloom in the distance.

EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

[[Scene 60-IV: Night falls - Names whispered into darkness]]

Full dark now. The sounds of the city muffled. Sung-ho has dozed off, head against the wall, cigarette burned down to nothing in his fingers.

Jake stares at the stars. Or where the stars would be if Seoul's light pollution didn't drown them out.

He thinks about his mother. Her last letter. "Do you know who you are?"

He thinks about the students. Their faces when they finally understood something he taught them.

He thinks about the four agents whose names Mr. Kim spoke like weapons.

Agent Yoo. Park Jong-woo. Kim Sun-hee. Lee Hyun-ki.

He whispers their names into the darkness.

JAKE
(barely audible)
I'm sorry.

It's not enough. It will never be enough.

But it's a start.

EXT. BACK ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 60A: Jake Alone - Internal reckoning]]

Sung-ho sleeps. Jake is utterly alone with his thoughts.

He looks at his hands. The hands that passed the documents. Delivered the packages. Shook Mr. Kim's hand and felt honored to serve.

He closes them into fists.

Opens them.

The alley stretches in both directions. One way leads deeper into the labyrinth of Seoul's back streets. A man could disappear there. New name. New face. New life.

The other way leads eventually to the main road. And from there - anywhere. The airport. A ship. Another country where no one knows the name Jake Cooper.

He could run.

He considers it. Really considers it. The appeal of simply vanishing. Becoming someone else. Again.

But that's what Mr. Kim offered, isn't it? A new identity. A new purpose. Another mask.

Jake looks down at the gun on the ground beside him. He'd picked it up without thinking. Old habit.

He picks it up now. Feels its weight.

There's another option. The one Sung-ho's friend from the army took. The quick exit. The final refusal to be anyone anymore.

His thumb finds the safety. Clicks it off.

The barrel is cold against his palm.

He thinks about his father's funeral. How small the casket looked. How his mother held his hand so tight it hurt.

He thinks about the classroom. The smell of chalk and paper. The sound of children laughing at his terrible Korean accent.

He thinks about Sung-ho, sleeping five feet away, who stayed even after learning the truth.

His thumb finds the safety. Clicks it back on.

He sets the gun down.

Not because he deserves to live. Maybe he doesn't. But because dying now means Mr. Kim wins. Means the four agents died for nothing. Means the truth stays buried.

And Jake is tired of being buried.

He leans his head against the wall. Closes his eyes.

What's left when everything you were is stripped away?

Maybe nothing. Maybe that's the point. Maybe you have to reach nothing before you can build something real.

He doesn't sleep. But he stops falling.

EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAWN

[[Scene 60B: Sung-ho's Return - The thematic line earned]]

First light. Gray and cold. The city beginning to stir.

Sung-ho wakes. Stretches. Groans at the stiffness in his back.

He looks at Jake. Still awake. Still alive.

SUNG-HO
(voice rough from sleep)
You didn't run.

JAKE
No.

SUNG-HO
I thought you might.

JAKE
I thought about it.

Sung-ho stands. Works the kinks out of his neck.

SUNG-HO
There's a pojangmacha around the corner. Probably open by now. We should eat.

Jake doesn't move.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
When's the last time you ate anything?

JAKE
I don't remember.

SUNG-HO
Then we eat. Then we figure out what comes next.

Jake looks up at him.

JAKE
I don't know what comes next.

Sung-ho extends his hand. Offers to help Jake up.

SUNG-HO
Neither do I. But I know you can't figure it out sitting in garbage.

Jake stares at the offered hand. A choice. Such a small thing.

He takes it. Pulls himself to his feet. Unsteady. Weak from hunger and exhaustion.

They stand in the alley. Morning light touching their faces.

JAKE
Everything I thought I was - the teacher, the spy, the patriot - it was all built on lies.

SUNG-HO
I know.

JAKE
So what's left? Who am I if all of that was fake?

Sung-ho looks at him. Really looks at him.

SUNG-HO
I've thought about this all night. Watching you break apart. Watching you put yourself back together.

(beat)

You want to know who you are?

JAKE
I don't know anymore.

SUNG-HO
(simple, direct)
What's left? A man standing in an alley at dawn, trying to decide if he wants to keep breathing.

Jake flinches.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
I saw the gun. I saw you pick it up. Put it down.

(beat)

You chose to stay. That's something they didn't program. That's something Kim can't explain away.

JAKE
It doesn't feel like enough.

SUNG-HO
It's a beginning. And beginnings are what you have now. Not a past. Not an identity. Just this moment, and the next one, and what you choose to do with them.

Jake looks at the morning light. The city coming alive around them.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
So. Who do you want to be?

Long silence. Jake looking at the light creeping into the alley. The city waking up around them.

JAKE
(slowly, as if testing the words)
Someone who faces what he did. Who tells the truth about it. Even if it means prison. Even if it means being no one again.

(beat)

Someone who earns his conscience back.

Sung-ho nods. No judgment. No celebration. Just acknowledgment.

SUNG-HO
한 걸음씩.
*One step at a time.*

JAKE
한 걸음씩.

They walk out of the alley together. Into the light.

## SEQUENCE 14 - THE CHOICE

= Jake makes his decision and prepares for what comes next.

INT. PHONE BOOTH - MORNING

[[Scene 61: Jake makes the call - Extended]]

A cramped phone booth on a busy Seoul street. Morning rush hour flowing past the glass.

Jake stands inside, receiver in hand. He hasn't dialed yet.

He watches the people passing. Businessmen with briefcases. Students with backpacks. A mother pushing a stroller.

None of them know that three South Korean agents are dead because of a man standing ten feet away.

He dials the number. His hands are steady now. The shaking stopped sometime in the night.

OPERATOR (V.O.)
United States Embassy. How may I direct your call?

Jake's finger hovers over the disconnect button. One last chance to run. One last chance to disappear.

JAKE
I need to speak with the Regional Security Officer.

OPERATOR (V.O.)
May I ask what this is regarding?

JAKE
My name is Jake Cooper. I'm an American citizen.

(beat)

And I have information about a North Korean intelligence operation that's been running for two years. Using American assets. Using me.

Long pause on the line.

OPERATOR (V.O.)
Please hold, Mr. Cooper.

Hold music. Tinny and distant.

Jake watches Seoul through the glass. The city that's been his home. His cover. His trap.

A new voice on the line. Male. Alert.

RSO (V.O.)
This is Regional Security Officer Barrett. Mr. Cooper?

JAKE
Yes.

RSO (V.O.)
Before we go any further - are you under duress? Is someone making you call?

JAKE
No. This is my choice.

RSO (V.O.)
Understood. Where are you now?

JAKE
Phone booth. About two miles from the embassy.

RSO (V.O.)
Can you come in? We can send someone to--

JAKE
No. I'll come myself. Give me an hour.

RSO (V.O.)
Mr. Cooper, if what you're saying is true, there may be people looking for you. Let us help--

JAKE
One hour. I'll be there.

He hangs up. Stands in the phone booth.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(to himself)
Okay. New game. New rules.

(beat)

My rules.

He pushes open the door. Steps into the morning.

EXT. STREETS OF SEOUL - MORNING

[[Scene 61-I: Morning farewell - Two friends part ways]]

Sung-ho waits across the street. Sees Jake emerge.

SUNG-HO
(as Jake approaches)
Done?

JAKE
Done. They're expecting me.

SUNG-HO
What happens now?

JAKE
I tell them everything. Kim's network. The operations. The agents who died.

(beat)

And then whatever happens, happens.

Sung-ho nods.

SUNG-HO
I should stay away from the embassy. Too many questions I don't want to answer.

JAKE
I know.

They stand on the sidewalk. People flowing around them like water around stones.

SUNG-HO
This is goodbye then. For now.

JAKE
For now.

Sung-ho pulls out a scrap of paper. Hands it to Jake.

SUNG-HO
My aunt's restaurant. Hongdae district. When this is over - if you need to find me.

Jake takes the paper. Folds it carefully into his pocket.

JAKE
Thank you. For everything. For staying.

SUNG-HO
(small smile)
You're my friend. Even when you're inconvenient.

They clasp hands. Hold for a moment.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
Go. Be who you want to be.

He walks away. Doesn't look back.

Jake watches him disappear into the crowd.

Then he turns. Starts walking toward the embassy.

EXT. ABANDONED ROOFTOP - MORNING

[[Scene 61A: The Gathering - Jake prepares]]

A rooftop overlooking Seoul. Jake stands at the edge, looking out at the city.

His jacket lies at his feet. He's methodically going through the pockets.

He pulls out a small handgun. Holds it. Considers it.

Sets it down.

A knife in an ankle sheath. He unbuckles it. Sets it beside the gun.

Lockpicks in a hidden pocket. He finds them. Adds them to the pile.

A coil of wire - garrote. He stares at it for a long moment. Then sets it down.

A small leather pouch. Inside: emergency cash. Fake IDs - two different names, neither of them Jake Cooper. Passport stamps for countries he's never visited.

He spreads them out on the concrete. The tools of his trade. The instruments of his false life.

One by one, he drops them off the edge of the building.

The gun falls. Clatters somewhere below.

The knife. The lockpicks. The garrote.

The IDs flutter down like wounded birds.

The cash scatters in the wind.

He keeps only his real passport - the one that says Jake Cooper. The one that proves he exists. Or existed.

He puts his jacket back on. It feels lighter.

JAKE
(V.O.)
Everything they gave me. Every tool of the lie.

He walks toward the rooftop door.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I don't need them anymore.

EXT. STREETS NEAR EMBASSY - MORNING

[[Scene 61-II: Final approach begins - The sedan returns]]

Jake walks through upscale streets. Embassy row. The US Embassy is visible ahead - American flag catching the wind.

He's almost there. One block away.

The BLACK SEDAN appears.

It slides up alongside him. Silent. Predatory. The same vehicle from Scene 7. From the night this all began.

Jake stops walking.

The rear door opens.

MR. KIM
(from inside)
Get in.

EXT. STREET NEAR US EMBASSY - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 61B: High Tower Surprise - The confrontation]]

Jake doesn't move.

MR. KIM (O.S.)
(patient)
I'm not going to shoot you in the street. Too many witnesses. Get in.

JAKE
No. We talk here.

Mr. Kim steps out of the sedan. Dark suit. Impeccable.

MR. KIM
(to his men, Korean)
여기 있어.
*Stay here.*

He approaches Jake.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
The embassy will interrogate you for months. Every mission, every contact. And when they're done, you'll be useless to them. Damaged goods.

JAKE
I know.

MR. KIM
So you're choosing a cell over a life.

JAKE
I'm choosing to find out.

MR. KIM
(amused)
Truth? That you helped four agents die? That every moment of your proud service was actually service to Pyongyang?

JAKE
Yes.

MR. KIM
Such waste. Come back. No more illusions - just clear-eyed work. Everyone uses everyone. The only difference is I'm honest about it.

JAKE
You said something last night. About my conscience. How even that was your design.

MR. KIM
(wary now)
I remember.

JAKE
I spent all night thinking about it. Whether anything I feel is real. Whether the guilt is just another tool you gave me.

MR. KIM
And?

JAKE
You needed me to believe I was good. Really believe it. So you built me to care. To feel things deeply. To want to matter.

(beat)

But here's the problem with building a man who cares: he cares. You can't fake that part. You had to make it real, or I wouldn't have worked.

MR. KIM
(edge creeping in)
Semantics--

JAKE
The wanting was real. You made sure of it. Which means when I feel sick about what I did - that's real too. You gave me a conscience so I'd seem human. But conscience is conscience. It doesn't come with an off switch.

MR. KIM
I could have my men put you in that car right now. By tonight you'd be across the DMZ.

JAKE
Then do it.

Silence. Jake doesn't flinch.

JAKE (CONT'D)
You came to convince me. Because if I walk into that embassy, your network burns. And I'm not coming back.

MR. KIM
(cold)
You'll spend the rest of your life paying for this.

JAKE
But at least I'll know what I chose.

He walks toward the embassy.

MR. KIM
I made you, Jake.

Jake stops. Doesn't turn.

JAKE
You made a man who wanted to do the right thing. And now he is.

(beat)

That's your legacy.

He keeps walking.

Mr. Kim watches. His face unreadable. Then he gets back in the sedan.

The car pulls away - in the opposite direction.

EXT. STREET - FINAL APPROACH - MORNING

[[Scene 61C: Dig Deep Down - The hardest steps]]

Jake walks toward the embassy. Alone now. No one following.

JAKE (V.O.)
I've walked a lot of streets in Seoul. Running drops. Avoiding tails. Playing the spy I thought I was.

He passes a coffee shop. Sees his reflection in the window. Barely recognizes himself.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
This is different. No mission. No extraction point. Just a man walking toward an open door.

His feet feel heavy. Each step an effort.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
The hardest thing I've ever done isn't fighting or running or lying. It's this. Walking into a building and telling the truth.

He's fifty yards from the embassy gate now.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
They're going to ask me questions I don't want to answer. They're going to make me relive every moment. Every mistake. Every death I caused without knowing.

Forty yards.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And I'm going to tell them. All of it. Because that's who I want to be.

Thirty yards.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Not the teacher. Not the spy. Not the asset or the patriot or the weapon.

Twenty yards. He can see the guards at the gate.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Just someone who tells the truth. Even when it hurts. Especially when it hurts.

He stops for a moment. Takes a breath. Looks at the American flag snapping in the wind.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
This is going to cost me everything. My freedom. Maybe my future. Definitely my peace of mind.

He starts walking again.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
But for the first time in two years - maybe my whole life - I know exactly who I am.

He reaches the gate.

## SEQUENCE 15 - THE NEW BEGINNING

= Jake walks into the unknown, transformed.

EXT. STREETS OF SEOUL - MORNING

[[Scene 62: Jake moves through the city - Extended]]

Jake walks through the streets of Seoul. Morning in full swing now. The city alive around him.

He passes businessmen with briefcases, hurrying to offices. Students with backpacks, comparing notes. Street vendors setting up their carts.

He's not hiding. Not scanning for threats. Not playing any role.

Just walking.

He passes a pojangmacha - a street food tent - where an old woman is cooking tteokbokki. The smell of spicy rice cakes fills the air.

VENDOR
(in Korean, calling out)
아저씨! 드시고 가세요!
*Mister! Come eat!*

Jake stops. Looks at her. Smiles for the first time in days.

JAKE
(in Korean)
다음에요. 고마워요.
*Next time. Thank you.*

She nods. Waves him on.

He keeps walking.

He passes a school. Pauses at the fence. Watches children streaming through the gates. Laughing. Pushing each other. Being young.

A girl - maybe ten years old - drops her bookbag. Papers scatter.

Before Jake can move, another student helps her pick them up. They giggle together.

Jake watches. Something loosening in his chest.

JAKE (V.O.)
The teacher. Maybe that part was real. The part that wanted to help. To make someone's life a little easier.

He moves on.

Through a market. Past temples and construction sites. Through the complicated, beautiful, chaotic city that's been his home.

EXT. HAN RIVER - MORNING

[[Scene 63: Final parting - Extended]]

Jake stands at the riverbank. The Han stretches before him - wide and slow and ancient.

The same spot where he and Sung-ho planned their escape. Different light now. Different man.

He takes out the scrap of paper Sung-ho gave him. Reads the address one more time. Memorizes it.

Then he folds it carefully and puts it back in his pocket.

JAKE
(to the river)
I don't know if I'll make it out of this. They might decide I knew more than I did. Might decide I was complicit.

The water flows past. Indifferent. Eternal.

JAKE (CONT'D)
But if I do get out - if there's something on the other side of this - I'm coming back.

He watches a boat passing in the distance.

JAKE (CONT'D)
Not to the life I had. That's gone. But maybe to something real. Something I choose.

He takes a last look at the river.

JAKE (CONT'D)
Goodbye, Seoul. For now.

He turns and walks toward the embassy.

EXT. US EMBASSY - MORNING

[[Scene 64: FINAL IMAGE - Jake enters the embassy - Extended]]

Jake stands across the street from the US Embassy. An imposing building. Secure fences. Guards at attention. The American flag catching morning light.

Inside: questions. Interrogations. Consequences.

The complete unraveling of everything he was.

But also - for the first time in his life - truth.

He stands there for a long moment. Just breathing.

JAKE (V.O.)
My mother asked me once if I knew who I was. I was seventeen. I said yes, of course. I was her son. I was American. I was going to change the world.

He starts across the street.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I was wrong. I didn't know anything.

He reaches the gate. The guards watch him approach.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I came to Seoul thinking I was a hero. A secret warrior for freedom and democracy. I believed it so completely.

The guard steps forward.

GUARD
Can I help you, sir?

JAKE
Jake Cooper. I called ahead.

The guard checks a list. His expression changes slightly. Professional concern.

GUARD
Yes, sir. If you'll follow me.

The gate opens. Jake steps through.

JAKE (V.O.)
I wasn't a hero. I was a weapon. Aimed at my own country by people I trusted.

He walks up the main path. The embassy building looms ahead.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Four agents died because of information I provided. Good people. With families. Dreams.

He reaches the main door. Another guard holds it open.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I can't bring them back. Can't undo what I did. The guilt - that's mine to carry. Forever.

He steps inside. Cool air conditioning. The hum of diplomacy.

A MAN IN A SUIT approaches. RSO Barrett.

RSO BARRETT
Mr. Cooper?

JAKE
Yes.

RSO BARRETT
This way, please.

Jake follows him down a corridor. Past offices. Past portraits of presidents. Into the bureaucracy of a nation he thought he was serving.

JAKE (V.O.)
But I can choose what happens next. That's the one thing they can't take away.

They reach a door marked REGIONAL SECURITY. Barrett opens it.

Inside: a conference table. Recording equipment. Two other men in suits.

The interrogation begins here.

Jake pauses at the threshold.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I'm going to tell them everything. Every mission. Every contact. Every lie I believed and every truth I discovered.

He steps inside. The door closes behind him.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I don't know what happens after. Prison, maybe. Exile. A lifetime of suspicion and distrust.

FADE TO:

EXT. US EMBASSY - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 64-I: The flag and the door - Jake inside, choice made]]

Outside. The embassy stands. American flag snapping in the wind. Seoul stretches in all directions - ancient temples and modern towers, tradition and change, millions of people living their complicated lives.

JAKE (V.O.)
But whoever I become - whatever comes next - that's going to be my choice.

The camera holds on the embassy. The closed door. The flag.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
My mother asked me if I knew who I was.

Beat.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I do now.

FADE TO:

INT. EMBASSY CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 64-II: The interrogation begins - This is the truth]]

Jake sits at the table. Recording equipment blinking. The men across from him waiting.

He takes a breath.

JAKE
(out loud)
Where do you want me to start?

RSO BARRETT
The beginning, Mr. Cooper. Tell us everything.

Jake nods. Squares his shoulders.

JAKE
My name is Jake Cooper. I'm twenty-three years old. And for the last two years, I've been a North Korean intelligence asset without knowing it.

(beat)

This is the truth.

He begins to talk.

> FADE TO BLACK.
