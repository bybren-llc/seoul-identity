# ACT ONE

## SEQUENCE 1 - TWO FACES

= Jake Cooper leads a double life in 1993 Seoul - beloved English teacher by day, CIA operative by night. We establish both identities before they begin to collide.

INT. KOREAN LANGUAGE SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

[[Scene 1: Opening Image - Warm afternoon light through windows, 1993 Seoul]]

A modest classroom. Posters of American landmarks line the walls. A chalkboard reads: "ENGLISH CONVERSATION - INTERMEDIATE."

JAKE COOPER, 23, American, stands at the front with easy confidence. Button-down shirt, sleeves rolled up. He looks more like a grad student than a spy.

Six KOREAN STUDENTS, ages ranging from teens to middle-aged, watch him attentively.

JAKE
(in perfect Korean)
Okay, everyone. Today we practice asking directions. But first--

He switches to English, gesturing dramatically.

JAKE (CONT'D)
Only English from now on. No Korean. Even if it hurts.

The students laugh nervously. An OLDER WOMAN, 50s, raises her hand.

OLDER WOMAN
(heavy accent)
Teacher... what if we don't know the word?

JAKE
Then you find another way. Use your hands. Draw a picture. Act it out.

He mimes being lost, spinning in circles, looking confused. More laughter.

JAKE (CONT'D)
In America, nobody cares if your grammar is perfect. They care if you try.

A TEENAGE BOY in the back looks skeptical.

TEENAGE BOY
You speak Korean very good. How long you study?

JAKE
(beat, then warm smile)
A long time. And I made many, many mistakes. Still do.

He moves to the chalkboard, writes: "EXCUSE ME, WHERE IS THE SUBWAY?"

JAKE (CONT'D)
Now. Everyone repeat after me...

INT. KOREAN LANGUAGE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - LATER

[[Scene 2: End of day, golden hour light through windows]]

Students file out. Jake stands at the classroom door, saying goodbye to each one.

JAKE
(to Older Woman)
Your pronunciation is getting much better, Mrs. Park.

She beams, bowing slightly. Jake returns it naturally.

The Teenage Boy hangs back. Approaches Jake hesitantly.

TEENAGE BOY
Teacher... why you come to Korea? Why not stay in America?

Jake's smile flickers - just for a moment. Then it's back.

JAKE
Sometimes the best opportunities are far from home.

The boy nods, not quite satisfied, and leaves.

Jake watches him go. His expression shifts - the warmth fading into something harder, more watchful. He checks his watch.

INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - EVENING

[[Scene 3: Small studio, careful organization beneath surface clutter]]

A different Jake. Same face, different energy.

He stands at a desk covered with papers, photographs, a MAP of Seoul with pins and thread connecting locations. A shortwave RADIO crackles with static in the corner.

Jake studies a photograph: a Korean man in a business suit, entering a building. He flips it over - handwritten notes in code.

His fingers tap the desk rhythmically. Nervous habit.

The radio crackles. Jake crosses to it, adjusts the dial.

VOICE (V.O.)
(through static, coded)
Songbird, confirm receipt. Package ready for collection.

Jake picks up the receiver.

JAKE
(flat, operational)
Songbird confirms. Location Charlie, 2300.

He clicks off. Stands motionless for a moment.

Then he crosses to a closet. Pushes aside teacher clothes to reveal: dark jacket, black jeans, running shoes. A small PISTOL in a hidden compartment.

He stares at the gun. Doesn't take it. Closes the closet.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(to himself, quietly)
Just a pickup. In and out.

He grabs the dark jacket. His teacher's smile is long gone.

EXT. KOREAN LANGUAGE SCHOOL - DAY

[[Scene 4: THE CATALYST - Harsh morning light, tension building]]

Jake approaches the school. Something's wrong. TWO BLACK SEDANS parked at odd angles. A small crowd of STUDENTS gathered outside, murmuring.

MRS. PARK (the older woman from class) spots Jake. Rushes to him.

MRS. PARK
(panicked, in Korean)
Teacher! Men inside - they have Mr. Choi!

JAKE
(sharp)
What men? How many?

MRS. PARK
Three. Maybe four. They say school owes money.

Jake's jaw tightens. He scans the building. Calculating.

JAKE
Go home. All of you. Now.

He moves toward the entrance. Mrs. Park grabs his arm.

MRS. PARK
Teacher, no - they have guns!

Jake gently removes her hand. His eyes have changed - the teacher is gone.

JAKE
(quiet, flat)
I know.

INT. KOREAN LANGUAGE SCHOOL - MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 5: Dim interior, shafts of light through dirty windows]]

Jake enters quietly. Moves through the hallway with trained precision - back to wall, checking corners. Nothing like a teacher.

Voices from the director's office. Angry Korean. A man pleading.

Jake pauses outside the door. Listens.

THUG #1 (O.S.)
...last warning. The money, or we take something more valuable.

MR. CHOI (O.S.)
(desperate)
Please - I don't have it. Give me one more week--

The sound of a SLAP. Mr. Choi cries out.

Jake's hand moves to the door handle. Stops.

This isn't his fight. He should walk away. Call in a report. Stay in cover.

Another SLAP. A woman SCREAMS - a secretary, maybe.

Jake closes his eyes. Opens them. Decision made.

He pushes open the door.

INT. DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 6: Cramped office, four men, one weapon visible]]

MR. CHOI, 60s, school director, cowers behind his desk. Blood on his lip. His SECRETARY huddles in the corner.

THREE THUGS in cheap suits. THUG #1 holds a pistol loosely at his side. THUG #2 has brass knuckles. THUG #3 guards the door - which Jake just came through.

Everyone freezes.

JAKE
(calm, in Korean)
I'm looking for the restroom. Wrong door.

He starts to back out. Thug #3 blocks him.

THUG #1
(sneering)
The American teacher. I heard about you.

JAKE
I'm nobody. I teach English. That's all.

Thug #1 steps closer. Studies Jake's face.

THUG #1
You teach English. But you move like a soldier.

Beat. Jake's mask slips - just for a second.

THUG #1 (CONT'D)
Who are you really?

JAKE
(flat)
Someone you should let walk away.

Thug #1 LAUGHS. Raises his pistol toward Jake.

What happens next takes three seconds.

Jake catches Thug #1's wrist, twists, strips the gun. Elbow to Thug #2's throat. Thug #3 rushes him - Jake sidesteps, uses momentum to slam him into the wall.

All three thugs down. Jake stands over them, breathing hard, holding the pistol professionally. Finger off trigger. Barrel down.

Mr. Choi stares, mouth open.

MR. CHOI
How did you--

JAKE
(cutting him off)
Call the police. Tell them it was a robbery. You fought them off.

MR. CHOI
But--

JAKE
(harder)
You fought them off. Understand?

Jake looks at the pistol in his hand. The thugs groaning on the floor. His cover - six months of careful work - evaporating.

He sets the gun on the desk. Starts for the door.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(to himself)
Damn it.

EXT. KOREAN LANGUAGE SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

[[Scene 7: Jake exits, crowd has dispersed]]

Jake emerges into bright daylight. Pauses. Looks up.

Across the street, a BLACK SEDAN. Tinted windows. Watching.

Jake doesn't run. Doesn't hide. He walks toward it.

The rear window rolls down. MR. KIM, 50s, severe face, sits in the back seat. Cold eyes assess Jake.

MR. KIM
(in English, perfect diction)
That was impressive, Mr. Cooper. Reckless. But impressive.

JAKE
Who are you?

MR. KIM
Someone who's been watching you for a long time.

Jake's fists clench at his sides.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
Don't worry. I'm not here to expose you. Quite the opposite.

He gestures to the empty seat beside him.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
Get in. We have much to discuss.

JAKE
And if I don't?

MR. KIM
(cold smile)
Then your Agency will receive an interesting report about their asset's... extracurricular activities.

Beat. Jake looks back at the school. At the life he just burned.

He gets in the car.

The sedan pulls away.

EXT. SEOUL MARKET - NIGHT

[[Scene 8: Wide shot, low-key neon lighting]]

A bustling night market. Neon signs flicker. Vendors shout. Steam rises from food stalls.

Jake weaves through the chaos, slightly out of focus against the vivid backdrop. He moves cautiously, glancing at stalls, slipping through crowds.

He stops at a TTEOKBOKKI VENDOR. An OLD WOMAN, 70s, stirs the bubbling red sauce.

OLD WOMAN
(in Korean, not looking up)
You're early. The rice cakes need more time.

JAKE
(casual, ordering)
I'll wait.

She ladles some into a paper cup. Hands it to him. Their fingers brush - a SMALL FOLDED PAPER passes between them.

OLD WOMAN
(louder, for show)
Too much spice for American stomach, maybe.

JAKE
(taking a bite, eyes scanning)
I've learned to handle the heat.

The Old Woman's eyes flick to something behind Jake. A warning.

OLD WOMAN
(quieter)
Some heat you don't survive.

Jake pockets the paper. Drops won on the counter. Moves on without looking back.

Behind him, a MAN IN A DARK JACKET pauses at the same stall. The Old Woman is already serving another customer. Oblivious. Or pretending to be.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

[[Scene 9: Low-angle shot, moonlight with artificial light]]

Jake stands on the edge of a rooftop. Wind whips through his hair. Seoul spreads below - a sea of lights.

An UNKNOWN MAN, 40s, hard face, emerges from the stairwell. Dressed in black. One hand inside his jacket.

Jake doesn't turn around.

JAKE
You've been following me since Myeongdong. Either you're very bad at your job, or you wanted me to know.

UNKNOWN MAN
(thick Korean accent)
You're observant. For a teacher.

JAKE
(turning slowly)
What do you want?

UNKNOWN MAN
Information. Same as everyone in this city.

JAKE
I teach English. Verb conjugation. Proper use of articles.

UNKNOWN MAN
(stepping closer)
You teach lies. Same as us.

His hand moves inside his jacket. Jake tenses.

JAKE
If you were going to shoot me, you would have done it downstairs. Less wind. Cleaner shot.

The Unknown Man withdraws his hand - holding a BUSINESS CARD.

UNKNOWN MAN
Tomorrow. Noon. The address is on the back.

He extends it. Jake doesn't take it.

JAKE
And if I don't show?

UNKNOWN MAN
Then you'll never know who you're really working for.

He drops the card. It skitters across the rooftop. Stops at Jake's feet.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
Pleasant dreams, Mr. Cooper.

He backs toward the stairwell. Jake doesn't move. Doesn't look down at the card.

The Unknown Man disappears.

Beat. Jake's composure cracks - just slightly. He picks up the card. Stares at it.

JAKE
(to himself)
Who I'm really working for?

The question hangs in the cold air.

## SEQUENCE 2 - THE CONTACT

= Jake meets Mr. Han and receives information that will change everything.

INT. SMALL CAFE - NIGHT

[[Scene 10: Two-shot from side, low warm lighting]]

A dimly lit corner table. Two cups of barley tea. Steam rising.

MR. HAN, Korean, 50s, sits with perfect stillness. His face is weathered, eyes sharp. He wears simple clothes but carries himself like someone who once wore uniforms.

Jake slides into the seat across from him. Suspicious. Coiled.

JAKE
You wanted to meet. I'm here.

MR. HAN says nothing. Sips his tea. Waits.

JAKE (CONT'D)
The man on the rooftop. He works for you?

MR. HAN
(finally, measured)
He works for himself. Same as everyone.

JAKE
Including you?

MR. HAN
I work for the truth. A poor employer. Terrible benefits.

He pushes a FOLDER across the table. Jake doesn't touch it.

JAKE
What is this?

MR. HAN
An answer. To a question you haven't asked yet.

JAKE
I have a lot of questions.

MR. HAN
Start with this one: do you know who signs your checks?

Jake's eyes narrow.

JAKE
The State Department. Language and Cultural Exchange Program.

MR. HAN
(slight smile)
That's your teacher salary. I'm asking about the other one.

Beat. Jake's mask slips, just for a moment.

JAKE
(flat)
I don't know what you're talking about.

MR. HAN
Mr. Cooper. I've been doing this since before you were born. Don't insult us both.

He taps the folder.

MR. HAN (CONT'D)
Your Agency. The men who give you orders. The drops in Yongsan. The coded broadcasts. I know all of it.

Jake's hand moves toward the folder. Stops.

JAKE
Then what do you want from me?

MR. HAN
I want you to open the folder. And then I want you to tell me who you see.

Jake opens the folder. Inside: PHOTOGRAPHS. Official documents. Names he recognizes.

His expression shifts - confusion to concern.

JAKE
These are... these are my contacts. How did you--

MR. HAN
Look at the last page.

Jake flips to the end. A PHOTOGRAPH of MR. KIM - the man from the black sedan. But next to it, another photo. The same face, younger. In a North Korean military uniform.

JAKE
(breath catching)
That's not possible.

MR. HAN
Many things seem impossible until they're not.

JAKE
Kim works for the South. He recruited me. He--

MR. HAN
(cutting him off, gentle)
Mr. Kim works for the people who pay him most. Today, that is Pyongyang. Tomorrow, who knows? Loyalty is expensive. He sells to the highest bidder.

Jake stares at the photo. His world tilting.

JAKE
Why are you telling me this?

MR. HAN
Because you have a choice to make. And I believe you deserve to make it with open eyes.

JAKE
A choice between what?

MR. HAN
(leaning back)
That's for you to discover. I'm just an old man who serves tea and shares photographs.

He finishes his tea. Rises.

MR. HAN (CONT'D)
Study the folder. Verify what you can. And when you're ready to ask the right question--

JAKE
What's the right question?

MR. HAN
(at the door, turning back)
Not "who am I working for." The right question is "who do I want to be?"

He walks out.

Jake sits alone. The folder open. His certainties crumbling.

He picks up the photograph of Kim. His hands are shaking.

JAKE
(to himself)
Who do I want to be?

He doesn't have an answer.

INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

[[Scene 10B: Overhead shot, dim table lamp]]

The folder from Mr. Han spread across Jake's desk. PHOTOGRAPHS and DOCUMENTS scattered.

Jake leans heavily over the desk, shuffling the photographs. He stops at one particular photo, his face tightening with realization.

## SEQUENCE 3 - UNDERGROUND

= Jake flees through Seoul's underbelly, leading to his first direct confrontation.

INT. SEWER SYSTEM - NIGHT

[[Scene 11: Low-angle tracking shot, flashlight beam]]

Jake climbs down into the sewer. His breathing labored. He uses a flashlight to navigate the narrow, damp tunnel.

Water drips. Rats scatter. Jake moves fast, splashing through ankle-deep water.

He stops. Listens.

Footsteps behind him. Measured. Patient.

JAKE
(under breath)
Come on. Come on.

He kills the flashlight. Presses against the damp wall.

The footsteps continue. Getting closer.

INT. SEWER INTERSECTION - NIGHT

[[Scene 12: Close-up alternating shots, flashlight illumination]]

Jake reaches an intersection. Three tunnels branch off. He chooses left--

A FLASHLIGHT BEAM catches him from behind.

PURSUER (O.S.)
Wrong way, Mr. Cooper.

Jake freezes. Turns slowly. The Pursuer stands twenty feet back - professional stance, hand inside his jacket.

JAKE
(flat)
Who are you?

PURSUER
Someone who's been following you for six months. You're not as careful as you think.

JAKE
If you wanted me dead, I'd be dead.

PURSUER
(slight smile)
True.

Beat. Water drips between them.

PURSUER (CONT'D)
The package you delivered last week. What did you think was in it?

JAKE
Documents. Intel.

PURSUER
It was names. South Korean assets. Three of them are dead now.

Jake's jaw tightens.

JAKE
You're lying.

PURSUER
Am I? Ask yourself - have you ever met your handler? In person?

Silence. The question hangs.

PURSUER (CONT'D)
(in Korean)
You're on the wrong side, American. You just don't know it yet.

The Pursuer steps back into darkness.

PURSUER (CONT'D)
(English)
The warehouse. Tonight. Midnight. Come alone.

His flashlight clicks off. Footsteps receding.

Jake stands in the dark. Alone with the rats and the doubt.

JAKE
(barely audible)
Damn it.

EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY

[[Scene 13: Wide shot from behind, natural daylight]]

Jake emerges from a manhole onto a busy street. A delivery truck covers his exit.

He blends with the crowd instantly. Baseball cap pulled low. Eyes scanning.

A PAYPHONE on the corner. Jake crosses to it. Drops coins. Dials.

JAKE
(into phone, low)
Songbird checking in. I need to verify my handler's identity. Authorization code delta-seven.

Static. Then:

VOICE (V.O.)
(filtered)
Songbird, your handler is secure. Proceed with mission parameters.

JAKE
I need a name. A face. Something concrete.

VOICE (V.O.)
That's not protocol, Songbird.

JAKE
Protocol just got three people killed.

Long pause.

VOICE (V.O.)
Continue current operations. We'll review your concerns at next scheduled contact.

CLICK. Line dead.

Jake hangs up. Stares at the phone.

JAKE
(under breath)
Review my concerns.

He pulls his cap lower. Disappears into the crowd.

# ACT TWO

## SEQUENCE 4 - THE OLD FRIEND

= Jake reunites with Sung-ho, and they begin to plan.

INT. SUNG-HO'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY

[[Scene 14: Medium close-up from inside, warm interior lighting]]

Jake knocks on a weathered apartment door. After a tense pause, SUNG-HO, Korean, 40s, opens it, startled.

Sung-ho's face cycles through shock, relief, then concern in rapid succession.

SUNG-HO
(in Korean)
Ya! You crazy bastard.

JAKE
(quiet)
Hi, hyung.

SUNG-HO
(switching to English, urgent)
Two years. Two years, no word. Now you knock on my door in daylight?

JAKE
I know. I'm sorry.

SUNG-HO
(looking past Jake, checking the hall)
Sorry doesn't fix stupid.

They share a brief, intense look. Sung-ho pulls Jake inside, closing the door behind them.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(as door closes)
Get in before someone sees you.

INT. SUNG-HO'S APARTMENT - DAY

[[Scene 15: Over-the-shoulder shot, warm dim lighting]]

Jake and Sung-ho sit on the floor around a low table. SOJU bottles between them. Documents spread across the table.

The apartment is small, cluttered with books and old newspapers. A photo of a young woman on a shelf - Sung-ho's sister.

Sung-ho watches Jake, who stares at nothing. Neither has spoken.

SUNG-HO
(finally)
When did you last eat?

JAKE
I don't remember.

Sung-ho rises. Goes to a small kitchen area. Returns with leftover rice and kimchi in a plastic container.

SUNG-HO
Eat.

JAKE
I'm not hungry.

SUNG-HO
(firm)
Eat. Then we talk.

Jake picks at the food. His hands are shaking slightly. Sung-ho notices but says nothing.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
My neighbor saw you come in. She'll tell everyone an American is visiting.

JAKE
I'm sorry. I didn't know where else--

SUNG-HO
(cutting him off)
Stop apologizing. Tell me what happened.

Jake sets down the chopsticks. Takes a breath.

JAKE
I've been in Seoul two years. You know what I do.

SUNG-HO
I know what you told me. CIA. Intelligence work. "Making a difference."

There's something in his tone. Jake catches it.

JAKE
You didn't believe me?

SUNG-HO
I believed you believed it.

Beat. Jake doesn't know how to take that.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
Go on.

JAKE
Three weeks ago, everything stopped. My handler - a voice on a phone, I never met him in person - went silent. My drop points were cleaned out. Then someone tried to grab me near Yongsan Station.

SUNG-HO
Grab you. Not kill you?

JAKE
They had a van. Flex cuffs. They wanted me alive.

SUNG-HO
Who?

JAKE
Korean. Not military - wrong haircuts. Not police. Maybe--

SUNG-HO
Maybe KCIA.

JAKE
Maybe.

Sung-ho pours soju into two small glasses. Slides one across.

SUNG-HO
(in Korean)
To confusion.

They drink.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(back to English)
Show me.

Jake spreads documents across the table. Photos. Reports. A crude map with handwritten notes.

JAKE
This is two years of work. Every contact. Every operation. Every piece of intelligence I gathered.

Sung-ho studies a photo. His brow furrows.

SUNG-HO
This man. You know who this is?

JAKE
North Korean asset. Code name "Sparrow." My handler flagged him for surveillance.

SUNG-HO
(quiet)
This man is my wife's cousin.

Jake freezes.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
He works at a fish market in Busan. He's not a spy, Jake. He's an accountant.

JAKE
That's... that can't be right.

SUNG-HO
(pointing to another photo)
And this one?

JAKE
Another target. "Magpie." Suspected courier.

SUNG-HO
She teaches Sunday school at my church.

Jake stares at the photos. The room suddenly feels very small.

JAKE
What the hell is going on?

INT. SUNG-HO'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 16: Close-up on Jake, warm table lamp]]

Jake is pacing now. Sung-ho remains seated, watching.

JAKE
Two years. I gave them two years.

SUNG-HO
Gave who?

JAKE
(stopping)
I don't know anymore.

He crouches. Starts arranging papers in a new pattern.

JAKE (CONT'D)
I thought I was building something. A network. Intelligence that mattered. Operations that made a difference.

SUNG-HO
And now?

JAKE
Now I'm looking at innocent people I marked as enemies. Reports for missions I never ran. A career that might have been smoke the whole time.

He lines up three operation reports.

JAKE (CONT'D)
These three dates. February fifteenth. March third. April twenty-second.

SUNG-HO
What about them?

JAKE
All three were days I couldn't have been operational. Hospital. Surveillance. And this one--
(pointing)
April twenty-second was Easter. I was at an American church service in Itaewon. Surrounded by Marines.

He slams his hand on the table. Sung-ho flinches.

JAKE (CONT'D)
Bulletproof alibis. For missions someone else completed in my name.

SUNG-HO
Why would they need alibis?

JAKE
(the realization hitting)
Because when it all falls apart, I'm the one holding the evidence. I'm the one who looks guilty.

SUNG-HO
Guilty of what?

Jake looks at his friend. The weight of it crushing him.

JAKE
Whatever they've been doing. Whatever these missions actually were.
(beat)
I'm the fall guy, hyung. That's all I've ever been.

INT. SUNG-HO'S APARTMENT - LATER

[[Scene 17: High-angle shot on map, warm hanging light]]

A large MAP spread across the floor. Jake and Sung-ho sit cross-legged, leaning over it. Empty soju bottles pushed aside.

Jake's finger traces a path through the financial district.

JAKE
Kim's building. Here.

SUNG-HO
Security?

JAKE
Heavy. Two lobby guards, one in the garage.

SUNG-HO
Cameras?

JAKE
Everywhere. But there's a forty-second gap in the rotation at the service entrance.

Sung-ho adds a note beside the building.

SUNG-HO
I know a better way.

Jake looks up.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
Building next door. Older. Worse security. Roof access connects through a maintenance hatch.

JAKE
You've been there?

SUNG-HO
(beat)
I wasn't always a good man, Jake.

JAKE
You're a good man now.

SUNG-HO
(ignoring this)
We go in through the neighbor. Down through the hatch. Kim's floor is fourth.
(drawing the path)
Here.

JAKE
What about the electronic locks?

SUNG-HO
(producing a small device from his pocket)
Radio Shack. Amazing what you can build.

Jake almost smiles. Sung-ho doesn't.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
This is dangerous.

JAKE
I know.

SUNG-HO
You could run. Leave Korea. Start over somewhere they can't find you.

JAKE
Could you?

Sung-ho considers this. Then:

SUNG-HO
No. I couldn't.

He makes a final mark on the map.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
One o'clock. Midnight shift change gives us the smallest crew.

JAKE
One o'clock.

They exchange serious glances.

SUNG-HO
(in Korean)
Let's hope we're not both idiots.

JAKE
(in Korean)
Too late for that.

INT. SUNG-HO'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

[[Scene 18: Medium shot, low warm lighting]]

Jake kneels by his BACKPACK, organizing items quickly but meticulously. Flashlight. Lock picks. A small camera.

Sung-ho approaches. Holds out a small, old-fashioned WALKIE-TALKIE.

SUNG-HO
Channel seven. Two clicks for clear.

Jake takes it. Their hands touch briefly.

JAKE
Where'd you get this?

SUNG-HO
Same place I got everything else. Don't ask.

Jake stands. They face each other.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
The photo of my sister. On the shelf.

Jake looks at it. The young woman, smiling.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
She's married now. Two children. Living in Busan.

JAKE
I didn't know.

SUNG-HO
Because of you. What you did for her... I never said thank you.

JAKE
You didn't have to.

SUNG-HO
I'm saying it now.

Beat. The weight of history between them.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(lighter)
Now go. Before I change my mind and make you stay here forever.

JAKE
(almost smiling)
Your cooking would kill me first.

SUNG-HO
(in Korean)
Disrespectful American.

JAKE
(in Korean)
Stubborn Korean.

Jake shoulders the backpack. Moves to the door.

SUNG-HO
Jake.

He turns.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
Whatever you find in there... whatever the truth is... it doesn't change who you are.

JAKE
I don't know who I am.

SUNG-HO
(simple)
You're my friend. That's enough.

Jake holds his gaze. Nods once.

Then he's gone.

Sung-ho stands alone in the apartment. Looks at the map still spread on the floor.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(to himself, in Korean)
Stupid. Both of us.

He crosses to the window. Watches Jake disappear into the night.

## SEQUENCE 5 - THE WAREHOUSE

= The first major confrontation.

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

[[Scene 19: Wide shot, flashlight as primary light]]

Jake enters cautiously, flashlight revealing old machinery and dusty corners. A shadow moves in the distance.

JAKE
(calling out, low)
Hello?

His flashlight sweeps the space. Rusted conveyor belts. Stacked pallets. A rat scurries.

UNKNOWN MAN (O.S.)
Turn that off.

Jake complies. Darkness.

UNKNOWN MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Good. Now walk forward. Twenty steps.

Jake walks. Counting silently. His footsteps echo.

UNKNOWN MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Stop.

A single WORK LIGHT clicks on - harsh, industrial. Jake squints.

The UNKNOWN MAN steps into the light. Korean, 40s, forgettable face. The kind of man you'd never remember. He holds a BRIEFCASE.

UNKNOWN MAN
You're late.

JAKE
I was being careful.

UNKNOWN MAN
No. You were deciding whether to come at all.

Beat. He's right.

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 20: Over-the-shoulder shot, flashlight and moonlight]]

Jake and the Unknown Man face each other. Ten feet apart.

JAKE
The man in the sewer. He works for you?

UNKNOWN MAN
He works for the same people I do. The same people you do.

JAKE
And who is that?

UNKNOWN MAN
(slight smile)
That's the question, isn't it?

He sets the briefcase on a crate between them.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
Open it.

JAKE
What's inside?

UNKNOWN MAN
Proof. Of what you've been doing for the past two years.

Jake doesn't move.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
You're afraid. Good. Fear means you're starting to understand.

JAKE
Understand what?

UNKNOWN MAN
That everything you believe about yourself is a lie.

Jake steps forward. Opens the briefcase.

Inside: FILES. PHOTOGRAPHS. Operational reports - some with Jake's code name. Some with faces he recognizes. Korean men and women.

JAKE
(scanning documents)
These are my reports. My operations.

UNKNOWN MAN
Keep reading.

Jake flips through. Stops at a photograph. A man - dead. Execution style.

JAKE
(quiet)
Who is this?

UNKNOWN MAN
Agent Yoo. South Korean intelligence. You delivered a package last October. He was dead within the week.

Jake's hand trembles.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
Page twelve.

Jake turns to it. More photos. More dead faces.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
Agent Park. Agent Sung. Agent Kim - no relation to your Mr. Kim, ironically. All eliminated after you provided their locations, their covers, their patterns.

JAKE
(barely audible)
I didn't know.

UNKNOWN MAN
No. You didn't. That's the clever part.

Jake looks up. The Unknown Man's face is unreadable.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
You were recruited by a man claiming to be CIA. Given training. A cover. A purpose. You believed because you wanted to believe.

JAKE
Who are you?

UNKNOWN MAN
A middleman. Like you. Except I know who signs my checks.

JAKE
Then tell me.

The Unknown Man considers this.

UNKNOWN MAN
The man you know as Mr. Kim. He's not Agency. He's not South Korean intelligence. He runs a network for Pyongyang. Has for twenty years.

Jake's world tilts.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
You've been a North Korean asset since the day you arrived in Seoul. You just didn't know it.

JAKE
That's not possible. I was vetted--

UNKNOWN MAN
You were cultivated. Big difference.

He reaches into his jacket. Jake tenses. The Unknown Man pulls out a PIECE OF PAPER.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
An address. A real CIA officer - actual Agency. He's expecting you. Bring the briefcase.

JAKE
Why would I trust you?

UNKNOWN MAN
You shouldn't. But you can verify everything in that case. And when you do, you'll know I'm telling the truth.

He steps back into darkness.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
One more thing. Kim knows you're here. He's cleaning house. Everyone connected to this operation.

JAKE
Including you?

UNKNOWN MAN
(from darkness)
Including me.

Silence.

JAKE
Wait--

A CRASH from somewhere in the warehouse. Jake spins.

The Unknown Man is gone.

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 21: Handheld shaky medium shot, rolling flashlight]]

An ATTACKER bursts from behind a crate. Black-clad. Fast.

UNKNOWN MAN (O.S.)
Down!

Jake ducks. The Attacker's blade whistles past his head.

The Unknown Man pulls a pistol - fires twice. The shots ECHO. The Attacker staggers but keeps coming.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
(Korean)
Run! Now!

A SECOND ATTACKER emerges from the shadows.

Jake grabs the briefcase. Sprints.

Behind him - struggle. A gunshot. A cry.

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 22: Tracking shot from behind, dynamic lighting]]

Jake runs through the cluttered warehouse. Briefcase clutched to his chest.

ATTACKER #2 (O.S.)
(Korean, shouting)
He has the files! Don't let him leave!

Jake vaults a conveyor belt. Crashes through a stack of pallets.

More FOOTSTEPS behind him. Multiple.

JAKE
(gasping)
Exit. Find an exit.

He spots a window ahead - grimy glass, weak frame.

Behind him, closer now:

ATTACKER #2 (O.S.)
(Korean)
Corner him! Corner him!

Jake doesn't slow down. Aims for the window.

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - WINDOW - NIGHT

[[Scene 23: Low-angle shot from outside, streetlamp and moonlight]]

Jake hits the window shoulder-first.

Glass SHATTERS. He drops eight feet. Lands hard. Rolls.

ATTACKER (O.S.)
(from window above, Korean)
Get to the street! Cut him off!

Jake scrambles up. The briefcase is still in his grip.

He runs.

Behind him, the warehouse lights up - flashlights, shouting, chaos.

Jake disappears into the night.

EXT. BACKSTREET - NIGHT

[[Scene 24: Medium side shot, mixed lighting]]

Jake stumbles out of an alley. Leans against a brick wall. Gasping.

Pedestrians walk past. A drunk businessman. A couple arguing. Normal life.

Jake forces himself upright. Checks his reflection in a shop window.

Blood on his jacket. Torn fabric. He looks like what he is - a man who just escaped something terrible.

JAKE
(to himself)
Blend. Blend in.

He buttons his jacket to hide the blood. Wipes his face. Steps into the flow of pedestrians.

Just another foreigner walking home.

EXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT

[[Scene 25: Low-angle close-up, flickering overhead light]]

Jake ducks into a narrow alley. Crouches beside old crates.

He sets down the briefcase. Clicks it open. The documents are still there.

Then he remembers - the paper. The address.

He reaches into his pocket. Pulls out a crumpled piece of paper - the one the Unknown Man gave him.

Jake holds it up to the flickering light.

An address. Itaewon district. And a name: CAPTAIN REEVES.

Below it, handwritten:

"He knows what you are. He can make you something else."

Jake stares at the words.

JAKE
(quiet)
Something else.

He folds the paper. Tucks it into his shirt pocket - close to his chest.

In the distance, SIRENS.

Jake picks up the briefcase. Moves deeper into the shadows.

## SEQUENCE 6 - THE CRACK

= Jake reviews his intel and notices something that doesn't add up. The first crack in his certainty.

INT. SUBURBAN HOME - KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)

[[Scene 26: Medium shot, warm morning light]]

YOUNG JAKE, teenage, sits at a kitchen table with his MOTHER. They discuss an opportunity in Korea. His mother looks worried but supportive.

MOTHER
You're sure this is what you want? It's so far away.

YOUNG JAKE
It's a chance to be someone, Mom. To matter.

She places her hand gently on his arm.

MOTHER
You already matter. You know that, right?

Young Jake looks away. He doesn't believe her.

INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (PRESENT)

[[Scene 27: MIDPOINT REVERSAL - Single lamp, shadows, revelation]]

Jake sits on the floor surrounded by documents. The folder from Mr. Han. Photos. The intel from his Agency contacts. Reports from Mr. Kim.

He's cross-referencing. Something bothers him.

JAKE
(muttering)
This doesn't make sense.

He holds up two photographs side by side. The SAME MAN - but one photo is labeled as a North Korean agent, the other as a South Korean asset.

JAKE (CONT'D)
Wait...

He shuffles through more papers. Finds a date discrepancy. An operation report claims Jake delivered a package on March 3rd. But he was in the hospital that day. Food poisoning. He remembers it clearly.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(growing alarm)
I wasn't even there. I was sick. Who...

His phone RINGS. Jake freezes. Stares at it.

It rings again. He answers.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(cautious)
Yeah?

MR. KIM (V.O.)
(filtered)
Mr. Cooper. I trust you received the updated intelligence.

JAKE
I'm looking at it now.

MR. KIM (V.O.)
Good. The target will be at the location tomorrow night. Don't be late.

Jake looks at the contradicting photos.

JAKE
Who verified this intel?

Silence on the line.

MR. KIM (V.O.)
(colder)
That's not your concern. Your concern is completing the mission.

JAKE
I'm asking because something doesn't--

MR. KIM (V.O.)
(sharp)
Questions are dangerous, Mr. Cooper. Especially the wrong ones.

CLICK. Line goes dead.

Jake stares at the phone. Then at the documents.

JAKE
(quietly, to himself)
What the hell is going on?

He looks at the map on his wall. All those pins. All those connections. What if they're wrong? What if they've always been wrong?

His fingers start tapping the floor. Nervous habit.

For the first time since he arrived in Seoul, Jake Cooper doesn't know what's true.

## SEQUENCE 7 - THE RIVER

= Jake and Sung-ho plan their next move by the Han River.

EXT. HAN RIVERBANK - NIGHT

[[Scene 28: Wide shot, city lights reflecting]]

Jake waits on the edge of the Han River. City lights reflect in the water. Sung-ho approaches. They exchange a silent nod.

SUNG-HO
(low, in Korean)
You weren't followed?

JAKE
Three changes. Doubled back twice.

SUNG-HO
Good.

He settles beside Jake. Both stare at the water.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
The meeting with Park's contact. It's confirmed?

JAKE
Dawn. Industrial district.

SUNG-HO
(nodding slowly)
Then we move.

EXT. HAN RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 29: Over-the-shoulder shot, moonlight and city lighting]]

Jake and Sung-ho sit side-by-side, talking in hushed tones. Jake points out a building in the distance.

JAKE
(pointing)
See that building? The one with the red light on top?

SUNG-HO
The textile factory?

JAKE
Used to be. Now it's a front for Kim's logistics.

SUNG-HO
How do you know?

JAKE
I delivered there. Twice. Never knew what was in the packages.

SUNG-HO
(grim)
Now you do.

JAKE
Now I do.

Beat. The weight of that knowledge between them.

SUNG-HO
The contact - he'll have equipment?

JAKE
Radio transmitter. Frequencies for the embassy. Everything we need to blow this open.

SUNG-HO
(skeptical)
And you trust him?

JAKE
I don't trust anyone. But I'm out of options.

EXT. HAN RIVERBANK - DOCK - NIGHT

[[Scene 30: Medium shot from water, moonlight on water]]

Jake and Sung-ho prepare to cross the river. A small, hidden BOAT tied to the dock.

Jake pulls back a tarp, revealing the weathered boat.

SUNG-HO
(eyeing it)
This is your plan? We'll sink before we're halfway.

JAKE
It floated when I hid it here.

SUNG-HO
When was that?

JAKE
Six months ago.

SUNG-HO
(muttering in Korean)
We're going to die.

Jake unties the rope. Holds the boat steady.

JAKE
Get in. Stay low.

Sung-ho climbs in. The boat groans but holds.

SUNG-HO
If I drown, I'm haunting you.

JAKE
(pushing off)
Get in line.

EXT. HAN RIVER - NIGHT

[[Scene 31: Wide aerial shot, moonlight reflecting]]

Jake and Sung-ho row across the Han River. City lights glisten in the distance.

Long silence. Just the sound of oars cutting water.

SUNG-HO
(quiet)
What happens after?

JAKE
After what?

SUNG-HO
After you give them everything. Kim's network. The operations. What happens to you?

Jake keeps rowing. Doesn't answer.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
Jake.

JAKE
(flat)
I don't know. Prison, maybe. If they believe me.

SUNG-HO
And if they don't?

JAKE
Then it doesn't matter.

More silence. The far shore grows closer.

EXT. OPPOSITE RIVERBANK - NIGHT

[[Scene 32: Low-angle shot, ambient moonlight]]

They reach the riverbank. Pull the boat onto the sand. Jake signals Sung-ho to stay low.

Jake jumps out first. Crouches. Listens.

JAKE
(barely audible)
Wait.

SUNG-HO freezes. Ten seconds. Twenty.

A car passes on the road above. Headlights sweep. Gone.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(gesturing)
Now. Stay in the shadows.

They drag the boat into the reeds. Move toward the treeline.

SUNG-HO
(whispering)
Which way?

Jake points. They move.

EXT. ROADSIDE - NIGHT

[[Scene 33: Tracking shot from behind, streetlight pattern]]

Jake and Sung-ho move along a deserted road, keeping to the shadows. Sung-ho clutches a map.

They pause where two roads intersect.

SUNG-HO
(checking map)
Left here. Half kilometer.

JAKE
You're sure?

SUNG-HO
(folding the map)
I'm sure. I used to run deliveries in this district.
(beat)
Before I was a good man.

They continue. Jake glances back once.

JAKE
No tail.

SUNG-HO
Not yet.

## SEQUENCE 8 - THE SAFEHOUSE

= They reach temporary safety and plan the final confrontation.

EXT. HIDDEN SAFEHOUSE - INDUSTRIAL AREA - NIGHT

[[Scene 34: Medium shot, flickering overhead bulb]]

Jake and Sung-ho approach a nondescript building. A GUARD appears briefly from the shadows.

Jake stops. Hands visible.

JAKE
(in Korean)
The sparrow flies at midnight.

The GUARD, 50s, weathered face, studies them.

GUARD
(gruff)
That phrase is three months out of date.

Tension. Sung-ho's hand moves toward his jacket.

GUARD (CONT'D)
(slight smile)
But close enough.

He unlocks the door. Steps aside.

GUARD (CONT'D)
Sung-ho. I heard you'd gone straight.

SUNG-HO
I heard the same about you.

GUARD
(shrugging)
We do what we can.

They enter. The door closes behind them.

INT. SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT

[[Scene 35: Wide shot, overhead yellowish light]]

A sparsely furnished room. MAPS and OLD RADIOS scattered across a table. The air smells like cigarettes and old paper.

Jake surveys the room. Sung-ho goes straight to the radios.

SUNG-HO
(examining equipment)
Half of this is junk.

GUARD
The other half works. That's more than most places can offer.

JAKE
What about weapons?

GUARD
(nodding toward a cabinet)
Two pistols. Limited ammunition. This isn't an armory.

JAKE
It'll do.

He crosses to the map table. Spreads his documents alongside the existing maps.

SUNG-HO
(to Guard)
How long can we stay?

GUARD
Until dawn. After that, I can't guarantee anything.

SUNG-HO
Understood.

The Guard moves to the door.

GUARD
I'll be outside. One knock for clear. Three for trouble.

He's gone.

INT. SAFEHOUSE - MAP TABLE - NIGHT

[[Scene 36: Over-the-shoulder shot, spotlight on map]]

Sung-ho draws a line on the map. Jake watches intently.

SUNG-HO
(tracing route)
Industrial district. Here. The building Park mentioned.

JAKE
Access points?

SUNG-HO
Main entrance. Fire escape on the east side. Rooftop access from the neighboring building.

JAKE
The rooftop. That's how we go in.

SUNG-HO
(nodding)
Less exposure. But we need to move before full light.

Jake studies the route. Something bothers him.

JAKE
If this contact is legitimate, why the rooftop? Why not just meet at street level?

SUNG-HO
Because he's careful. Like us.

JAKE
Or because it's a trap.

Beat. They look at each other.

SUNG-HO
(simple)
Maybe. But it's the only door that's open.

Jake looks at the map one more time.

JAKE
Then we go through it.

EXT. SAFEHOUSE - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

[[Scene 37: Medium shot from back, low-key lighting]]

Jake and Sung-ho exit through a back door. Both carry backpacks.

Jake pauses. Looks back at the safehouse.

SUNG-HO
Ready?

JAKE
(beat)
Define ready.

SUNG-HO
Breathing. Moving. Not dead yet.

JAKE
Then yeah. I'm ready.

They move into the shadows. The safehouse door closes behind them.

EXT. STREETS OF SEOUL - DAWN

[[Scene 38: Wide shot, diffused morning light with mist]]

Jake and Sung-ho walk through quiet streets. Morning mist clings to the ground. The city is just beginning to wake.

Long silence. Their footsteps echo.

SUNG-HO
(quiet)
My wife thinks I'm visiting my cousin in Busan.

JAKE
Will she forgive you?

SUNG-HO
For lying?
(beat)
She's used to it. Old habits.

JAKE
I'm sorry. For pulling you into this.

SUNG-HO
(slight smile)
You didn't pull me anywhere. I walked in with my eyes open.

They pass a street vendor setting up his cart. Normal life, starting another day.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(in Korean)
Whatever happens today - no regrets.

JAKE
(in Korean)
No regrets.

They continue walking. The sun begins to cut through the mist.

## SEQUENCE 9 - THE ROOFTOP DEAL

= The deal is made, but tensions rise.

EXT. INDUSTRIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP - DAWN

[[Scene 39: Medium low-angle shot, golden hour lighting]]

Jake and Sung-ho arrive at a rooftop. An UNKNOWN MAN, Korean, 50s, stands by equipment laid out on a tarp - radio transmitter, documents, a small case.

The Unknown Man doesn't turn around.

UNKNOWN MAN
(in Korean)
You're late.

SUNG-HO
(in Korean)
We were careful.

UNKNOWN MAN
(turning)
Careful would have been not coming at all.

He looks at Jake. Studies him.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
(switching to English)
The American. You're younger than I expected.

JAKE
Does that matter?

UNKNOWN MAN
Age is experience. Experience is survival. You've survived two years in Kim's network without knowing what you were doing.
(beat)
That's either very lucky or very stupid.

JAKE
Which do you think?

UNKNOWN MAN
(slight smile)
I think you're about to find out.

He gestures toward the equipment.

EXT. INDUSTRIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 40: Over-the-shoulder shot, warm early morning light]]

The Unknown Man hands Jake a RADIO TRANSMITTER and a piece of paper.

UNKNOWN MAN
Embassy frequency. Secure channel. They'll be monitoring from 0600.

Jake examines the transmitter.

JAKE
How do I know this isn't a trap?

UNKNOWN MAN
You don't.

SUNG-HO
(translating from the paper)
Call signs. Verification codes.
(to Unknown Man)
Where did you get these?

UNKNOWN MAN
From the same place I get everything. People who want Kim gone.

JAKE
Why? What's your stake in this?

UNKNOWN MAN
(flat)
Kim killed my brother. Nineteen eighty-seven. Made it look like a car accident.

Beat. The honesty of it catches Jake off guard.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
Is that enough motivation for you?

Jake pockets the transmitter. Folds the paper.

JAKE
It'll do.

EXT. INDUSTRIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 41: Medium close-up, bright morning light]]

Jake steps toward the Unknown Man. Aggressive.

JAKE
One thing I don't understand.

UNKNOWN MAN
Just one?

JAKE
If you have all this - the frequencies, the codes, the intel on Kim - why not go to the embassy yourself? Why do you need me?

UNKNOWN MAN
(cool)
Because you're the proof.

JAKE
What does that mean?

UNKNOWN MAN
Documents can be forged. Intelligence can be manufactured. But an American who was inside Kim's network for two years? Who can describe the operations, the contacts, the methods?
(beat)
That's evidence that walks and talks.

JAKE
(stepping closer)
You're using me.

UNKNOWN MAN
Everyone uses everyone. The question is whether the using serves a purpose you believe in.

Jake's jaw tightens. Sung-ho steps between them.

SUNG-HO
(firm)
Jake. We have what we came for.

JAKE
(to Unknown Man, hard)
If this is a setup - if any of this is wrong - I will find you.

UNKNOWN MAN
(unmoved)
I'm counting on it. Now go. Before Kim's people sweep this district.

EXT. INDUSTRIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP - STAIRWELL - DAWN

[[Scene 42: Tracking side shot, long shadows]]

Jake and Sung-ho move toward the rooftop stairwell. Quick, purposeful.

SUNG-HO
(low)
That went well.

JAKE
(sarcastic)
Fantastic.

They reach the stairwell door. Jake pulls it open.

SUNG-HO
You trust him?

JAKE
I trust the hate in his eyes when he talked about Kim.

SUNG-HO
That's not much.

JAKE
It's something real.

They descend. The rooftop door closes behind them.

EXT. NARROW ALLEY - DAWN

[[Scene 43: Medium side shot, natural morning light]]

Jake stops in the alley. Turns to Sung-ho.

JAKE
We should split up.

SUNG-HO
(immediate)
No.

JAKE
Two targets are easier to track than one. If Kim's people are watching--

SUNG-HO
Then we face them together.

JAKE
That's not smart.

SUNG-HO
(stubborn)
Smart would have been staying home. I'm past smart.

Beat. Jake's expression softens.

JAKE
If something happens to me, you need to get this to the embassy.
(holding up the transmitter)
You know enough to explain it.

SUNG-HO
And if something happens to you, who explains you?

Jake doesn't have an answer.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(quieter)
I'm not leaving you, Jake. Not now.

Long pause. Jake looks down the alley. Back at Sung-ho.

JAKE
Okay. Together. But if I say run, you run.

SUNG-HO
(in Korean)
We'll see.

EXT. END OF ALLEY - DAWN

[[Scene 44: Wide shot from behind, soft morning light]]

They reach the end of the alley. The city opens up before them - early morning traffic, people starting their day.

Jake stops. Turns to Sung-ho.

JAKE
Hyung.

Sung-ho looks at him.

JAKE (CONT'D)
Whatever happens after today... thank you. For believing me. When I didn't deserve it.

SUNG-HO
(simple)
You deserved it.

JAKE
I was working for the enemy.

SUNG-HO
You didn't know. The man I know - the one who saved my sister, who sits on my floor drinking soju and talking about nothing - that man is good.
(beat)
The rest is just... noise.

Jake absorbs this. Nods slowly.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(lighter)
Now. Are we going to stand here being emotional, or are we going to finish this?

JAKE
(almost smiling)
Let's finish it.

They clasp hands briefly. Not an embrace - too public, too exposed. But meaningful.

Then they step into the light. Two men walking toward whatever comes next.

# ACT THREE

## SEQUENCE 10 - THE INTELLIGENCE

= Jake receives critical information that changes everything.

EXT. DOWNTOWN ALLEY - NIGHT

[[Scene 45: Close-up on hands, low ambient light]]

Jake moves cautiously into the narrow alley. A HOODED FIGURE waits in shadow, back against damp brick.

Jake stops ten feet away. Hand near his jacket.

JAKE
(flat)
You're late.

HOODED FIGURE
(voice low, neutral)
I'm here. That's what matters.

The Figure extends a gloved hand. A small USB DRIVE between two fingers.

HOODED FIGURE (CONT'D)
Everything's on this. Names. Accounts. The whole network.

JAKE
Why?

HOODED FIGURE
Because someone should know the truth before it's too late.

Jake doesn't move to take it.

JAKE
Who are you?

HOODED FIGURE
(slight pause)
Someone who made the same mistake you did.

Jake studies the shadowed face. Sees nothing useful.

HOODED FIGURE (CONT'D)
Take it. Don't plug it in anywhere they can trace. And Cooper--

Jake reaches out. Takes the drive.

HOODED FIGURE (CONT'D)
Trust no one. Especially the people you think you know.

The Figure steps back into deeper shadow.

JAKE
Wait--

But the alley is empty. Just Jake, the drive, and the distant sound of traffic.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(under breath)
Great.

INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

[[Scene 46: Medium shot, blue computer glow]]

Jake sits at his desk. The USB drive plugged into a battered laptop. Screen glow illuminates his face.

Lines of data scroll. Names. Dates. Financial transfers.

JAKE
(muttering, reading)
Kim... Park... Yoo...

He clicks through files. His expression shifts from concentration to confusion.

JAKE (CONT'D)
These are Agency accounts. How did they--

More clicking. More data.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(growing horror)
No. No, that's not right.

A photograph loads. Agent Yoo - the same face from the warehouse briefcase. Next to it, a transfer record. Jake's code name.

JAKE (CONT'D)
I didn't authorize that. I never--

Another file. Another dead agent. Another transfer bearing his signature.

Jake pushes back from the desk. Runs his hands through his hair.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(barely audible)
Oh God.

He looks at the screen. The evidence is undeniable.

JAKE (CONT'D)
They used me. Every single time.

His hands are shaking. He reaches for the keyboard to scroll further--

INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 47: Close-up on face, dimming screen light]]

A sound from the hallway. Footsteps. Multiple.

Jake freezes. His eyes cut to the door.

JAKE
(whispered)
No.

The footsteps stop outside his apartment. A shadow passes under the door.

Jake is already moving. Grabbing the USB drive. Shoving the laptop into his backpack.

MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.)
(Korean)
This is the one. Go.

Jake doesn't hesitate.

EXT. JAKE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

[[Scene 48: Wide shot from street, streetlight and moonlight]]

Jake climbs out the window, backpack over shoulder. He lowers himself onto the fire escape, metal groaning under his weight.

JAKE
(hissed curse)
Damn it.

Above him, his apartment door CRASHES open. Shouts in Korean.

Jake descends fast. Too fast. His foot slips on a wet rung.

He catches himself. Keeps going.

Below: the alley. Above: flashlight beams sweeping through his window.

He drops the last eight feet. Lands hard. Runs.

EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

[[Scene 49: Side tracking shot, moonlight]]

Jake sprints across connected rooftops. Seoul spreads below - a sea of lights and shadows.

He reaches a gap between buildings. Six feet. Maybe seven.

Doesn't slow down.

JAKE
(under breath)
Don't think. Just go.

He jumps. Arms windmilling.

Lands on the far edge. Staggers. Catches himself on a ventilation unit.

Behind him, distant shouts. Flashlights bobbing on the rooftops.

Jake keeps running. Into the dark.

## SEQUENCE 11 - THE FINAL PLAN

= Jake and Sung-ho reunite and prepare for the final confrontation.

INT. OLD ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

[[Scene 50: Medium shot, dim industrial lighting]]

Jake slips through a broken side door. Pauses. Listens.

Movement in the shadows. Jake's hand goes to his waistband.

SUNG-HO (O.S.)
(Korean, low)
It's me.

Jake exhales. Sung-ho steps into dim light, face drawn with worry.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(switching to English)
I heard sirens near your building. I thought--

JAKE
They found my place. I got out.

SUNG-HO
(looking him over)
You hurt?

JAKE
No.

SUNG-HO
You sure?

JAKE
(beat)
Yeah. I'm sure.

They share a look. Relief beneath the exhaustion.

SUNG-HO
(quieter)
I was worried. Don't do that to me.

JAKE
(almost a smile)
I'll try.

Sung-ho gestures toward the factory interior.

SUNG-HO
This way. I found us a place to work.

INT. OLD ABANDONED FACTORY - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 51: Wide shot, yellowish glow]]

A bare concrete floor. A single work light. Maps spread out. Radio equipment. A concealed weapon laid beside a worn backpack.

Jake and Sung-ho sit cross-legged, sorting through their gear.

SUNG-HO
(checking items)
Transmitter. Backup battery. Maps of the district.

JAKE
The USB has everything. Kim's network. Money trails. Names of agents he turned.

SUNG-HO
(pause)
Including yours?

Jake doesn't answer. That's answer enough.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
So what's the play?

JAKE
We need to reach someone outside Kim's network. Real CIA. Real embassy contacts.

SUNG-HO
How do we know who's real?

JAKE
(bitter)
Good question.

Sung-ho adjusts the transmitter. Tests a frequency.

SUNG-HO
There's an emergency signal. Old frequency my unit used. If anyone's listening...

JAKE
If.

SUNG-HO
(shrug)
Better than nothing.

Jake looks at the equipment. Then at Sung-ho.

JAKE
You don't have to be part of this. What's on that drive - it's enough to get us both killed.

SUNG-HO
(matter-of-fact)
Already crossed that line. Might as well see it through.

JAKE
Why?

SUNG-HO
(simple)
Because you'd do the same for me.

Jake holds his gaze. Nods once.

JAKE
Dawn. We send the signal at dawn.

EXT. FACTORY ROOFTOP - DAWN

[[Scene 52: Low-angle shot from behind, city skyline]]

First light touches Seoul's skyline. Jake stands on the rooftop edge, transmitter in hand.

He extends the antenna. Adjusts the dial.

JAKE
(to himself)
Come on. Someone be listening.

He pushes the button. Three short pulses. Pause. Three more.

Holds his breath.

The city sprawls silent below. No response.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(quieter)
Please.

He waits. The transmitter is warm in his cold hands.

EXT. FACTORY ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 53: Close-up on face, dawn light and distant flashing]]

Jake squints at the horizon. Nothing.

Then--

A LIGHT. Distant. Flashing. Three short. Pause. Three short.

Jake's breath catches.

JAKE
(barely audible)
They heard us.

He watches the light repeat. Confirmation. Someone is out there.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(stronger now)
We're not alone.

He lowers the transmitter. Looks at the rising sun.

For the first time in days, something like hope crosses his face.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(to himself)
Time to finish this.

INT. OLD ABANDONED FACTORY - DAWN

[[Scene 54: Medium side shot, dim and ambient light]]

Jake comes down the stairs quickly. Sung-ho looks up from the equipment, tense.

SUNG-HO
(Korean)
Well?

JAKE
(nodding)
They responded. We have backup.

Sung-ho exhales. Allows himself a small smile.

SUNG-HO
How long?

JAKE
Don't know. But they're coming.

SUNG-HO
Then we need to move. Kim's people will figure out where that signal came from.

Jake crosses to the gear. Starts packing efficiently.

JAKE
The warehouse three blocks east. We set up there. Draw them in.

SUNG-HO
(pause)
You want to use ourselves as bait.

JAKE
I want to end this. Today.

Sung-ho considers. Then nods.

SUNG-HO
(gathering his pack)
Okay. Your plan.

They shoulder their bags. Check weapons.

JAKE
Ready?

SUNG-HO
(dark humor)
No. Let's go anyway.

They head for the exit.

## SEQUENCE 12 - THE TRAP

= The final confrontation.

INT. NEARBY ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAWN

[[Scene 55: Over-the-shoulder shot, dusty morning sun]]

Dusty morning light filters through broken skylights. Jake kneels by a support beam, adjusting wires connected to a makeshift trigger mechanism.

Sung-ho stands by the doorway, watching the street.

JAKE
(focused, low)
How's the street?

SUNG-HO
Quiet. For now.

Jake twists two wires together. Tests the connection.

JAKE
When they come through that door, these beams come down. Blocks the exit.

SUNG-HO
And if they come through another way?

JAKE
(glancing at him)
Then we improvise.

Sung-ho moves to a better vantage point. Checks his weapon.

SUNG-HO
How many you think?

JAKE
Kim won't send an army. Too visible. Four, maybe five.

SUNG-HO
We can handle five.

JAKE
(finishing the wires)
We have to.

He stands. Surveys the trap. The beams rigged above the entrance. The exit routes mapped in his head.

JAKE (CONT'D)
Stay low until I trigger it. Then we move fast.

SUNG-HO
(nodding)
Fast. I know fast.

They exchange a look. No more words needed.

Jake moves to his position behind stacked crates. Waits.

EXT. WAREHOUSE EXTERIOR - DAWN

[[Scene 56: Wide low-angle shot, soft morning light]]

Two MEN IN DARK SUITS move through the morning mist. Professional. Weapons drawn but lowered.

They approach the warehouse cautiously. Scanning windows. Checking corners.

INT. NEARBY ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Sung-ho crouches behind crates near the side entrance. Peers through a gap.

He sees them. Raises two fingers to Jake.

Jake nods. Ready.

EXT. WAREHOUSE EXTERIOR - CONTINUOUS

The lead man signals. They split. One toward the main door. One toward the side.

LEAD MAN
(low, Korean)
On three.

INT. NEARBY ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Sung-ho catches Jake's eye. Mouths: "They're here."

Jake's hand moves to the trigger wire.

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 57: High-angle shot, harsh shadows]]

The main door CRASHES open. First pursuer enters fast, weapon sweeping.

PURSUER #1
(Korean)
Clear the corners! Move!

The second man enters behind him.

Jake pulls the trigger wire.

METAL GROANS. The rigged beams CRASH down behind the pursuers, blocking their exit. Dust explodes into the air.

PURSUER #2
(Korean, shouting)
Trap! It's a trap!

Chaos. The men dive for cover, disoriented.

Jake emerges from behind the crates. Gun trained.

JAKE
(sharp)
Don't move!

Pursuer #1 spins toward the voice. Jake fires once - the shot sparks off concrete near the man's feet.

JAKE (CONT'D)
I said don't move!

SUNG-HO
(emerging, weapon ready)
Drop them! Now!

The pursuers freeze. Assess. Two against two, but Jake and Sung-ho have position.

PURSUER #1
(switching to English)
You're making a mistake, Cooper.

JAKE
Weapons. On the ground.

A tense moment. Then both pursuers lower their guns. Set them down.

JAKE (CONT'D)
Kick them away.

They comply. Metal scrapes across concrete.

Jake moves forward, keeping his gun steady. Sung-ho covers from the flank.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(to Pursuer #1)
Who else is coming?

PURSUER #1
(cold smile)
Everyone.

Behind them, the blocked door SHUDDERS. Someone trying to get through.

SUNG-HO
(urgent)
Jake. We don't have long.

Jake grabs Pursuer #1 by the collar. Shoves him against a crate.

JAKE
Then talk fast.

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 58: Medium close-up, diffused natural light]]

Jake grabs the LEAD PURSUER by the collar. Slams him against a crate.

JAKE
Who sent you? Was it Kim? The Agency?

The pursuer - we'll call him AGENT PARK - LAUGHS. Blood on his teeth.

AGENT PARK
(in Korean)
You still don't understand, do you?

JAKE
English. Now.

AGENT PARK
(switching, amused)
Your Korean is better than mine. But okay, Mr. Cooper. English it is.

He looks at Jake with something like pity.

AGENT PARK (CONT'D)
You want to know who sent us? Everyone did. That's the joke.

SUNG-HO
(weapon trained)
Jake. We don't have time for this.

JAKE
(ignoring him, to Agent Park)
Explain.

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 59: ALL IS LOST - Close-up on Jake, half-lit face]]

Agent Park leans back against the crate. Resigned. Almost relieved.

AGENT PARK
You think you've been working for the CIA. Running operations against North Korean assets.

JAKE
I have been.

AGENT PARK
(shaking head)
You've been running errands for Mr. Kim. Who works for Pyongyang. Every "mission" you completed - you were helping the other side.

Jake's grip loosens slightly. Agent Park sees it.

AGENT PARK (CONT'D)
The information you gathered? Went north. The packages you delivered? Helped identify South Korean agents. Three of them are dead because of you.

JAKE
(barely audible)
That's not possible. My handler--

AGENT PARK
Your "handler" at the Agency? He doesn't exist. The drop points, the coded messages - all routed through Kim's network.

Jake releases him. Steps back. The gun in his hand suddenly feels impossibly heavy.

JAKE
I was vetted. Trained. I've been filing reports for two years--

AGENT PARK
Reports to who? Did you ever see your control officer in person?

Silence. Jake didn't. He never did. It was always calls. Dead drops. Encrypted messages.

AGENT PARK (CONT'D)
Your entire identity was manufactured, Cooper. The "CIA agent" cover? That was Kim's operation. You're not a double agent who got caught - you were never on our side to begin with.

Jake staggers. Catches himself on a crate.

SUNG-HO
(confused, in Korean)
Jake? What is he saying?

Jake can't answer. Can't breathe.

AGENT PARK
The worst part? You believed it. Every mission, every dead drop, every night pretending to be a spy - you thought you were the hero.

(beat)

You were the weapon. Pointed at your own country.

Jake's world collapses. Everything he thought he knew. Every sacrifice. Every choice.

A lie.

JAKE
(broken, almost a whisper)
Who am I?

Agent Park actually looks sad.

AGENT PARK
That's the question, isn't it?

Jake stands motionless. The gun hangs at his side. Sung-ho calls his name but Jake can't hear him.

The teacher. The spy. The patriot.

All masks. And underneath - nothing he recognizes.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - BACK ALLEY - DAWN

[[Scene 60: Dark Night of Soul - First light, Jake broken]]

Jake stumbles out the back door. Sung-ho follows, confused and worried.

SUNG-HO
(in Korean)
Jake! What happened in there? What did he tell you?

Jake doesn't answer. Keeps walking. Reaches a wall. Stops.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
Talk to me. Whatever it is--

JAKE
(flat, hollow)
I'm not who I thought I was.

SUNG-HO
What does that mean?

Jake turns. His face is devastated.

JAKE
Everything I've done. Every mission. Every risk you took helping me. I was working for the wrong side. The whole time.

Sung-ho processes this.

SUNG-HO
North Korea?

Jake nods.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(long pause)
Did you know?

JAKE
No. But does that matter? People are dead because of me. South Korean agents. Our side.

SUNG-HO
It matters.

Jake looks at him.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
A weapon doesn't choose who fires it. You were aimed. That's not the same as choosing to pull the trigger.

JAKE
That's not--

SUNG-HO
(cutting him off)
What you did before - that's over. The question is what you do now.

Jake stares at the ground. The weight of everything pressing down.

JAKE
I don't know who I am anymore. The teacher was a cover. The spy was a lie. What's left?

Sung-ho steps closer. Puts his hand on Jake's shoulder.

SUNG-HO
(simple, direct)
What's left is a man standing in an alley, deciding who he wants to be.

Beat. Jake looks up.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
You have information about Kim's network. You know how he operates, who his contacts are. That's worth something to the right people.

JAKE
I don't know who the right people are. I don't know who to trust.

SUNG-HO
Then trust yourself. Decide what's right. Do that.

Jake looks at the rising sun. The first real light touching Seoul's skyline.

INT. PHONE BOOTH - MORNING

[[Scene 61: CLIMAX - Jake makes his choice]]

Jake stands in a cramped phone booth. Receiver pressed to his ear.

OPERATOR (V.O.)
United States Embassy, how may I direct your call?

Jake hesitates. His finger hovers over the disconnect button.

Then:

JAKE
I need to speak with the Regional Security Officer. My name is Jake Cooper. I'm an American citizen. And I have information about a North Korean intelligence operation targeting US assets in South Korea.

Long pause.

OPERATOR (V.O.)
Please hold, Mr. Cooper.

Jake exhales. He's chosen.

JAKE
(to himself, quiet)
Okay. New game. New rules.

He looks out the phone booth window at Seoul waking up around him.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Still here.

EXT. STREETS OF SEOUL - MORNING

[[Scene 62: Jake moves through the city]]

Jake walks through morning crowds. Business people. Students. Vendors opening shops.

For the first time, he's not hiding. Not performing. Just walking.

He passes a school. Pauses. Watches children file inside.

The teacher in him - maybe that part was real too.

EXT. HAN RIVER - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 63: Jake and Sung-ho part ways]]

Jake meets Sung-ho at the riverbank. The same spot from before, but different light. Different man.

SUNG-HO
The embassy?

JAKE
They want to meet. Debrief everything I know about Kim's operation.

SUNG-HO
And then?

JAKE
I don't know. Maybe home. Maybe somewhere else. Somewhere I can start over.

Sung-ho nods.

SUNG-HO
You're welcome here. You know that.

JAKE
(small smile)
In Korea, or in your apartment?

SUNG-HO
(returning the smile)
Both. Neither has hot water, but the company is good.

They share a moment. Two men who found something real amid all the deception.

JAKE
I'll find you. When this is over.

SUNG-HO
I know.

They clasp hands. Brief but meaningful.

Sung-ho walks away. Doesn't look back.

EXT. US EMBASSY - MORNING

[[Scene 64: FINAL IMAGE - Jake approaches the embassy]]

Jake stands across the street from the US Embassy. An imposing building. The American flag catching morning light.

Inside: questions. Debriefs. Consequences.

But also: truth. Finally.

He straightens his shirt. Runs a hand through his hair. Old habit from teaching - looking presentable.

JAKE
(V.O.)
My mother asked me once if I knew who I was. I didn't. Not then.

He steps off the curb. Starts walking toward the entrance.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I spent two years in Seoul pretending to be someone I wasn't. A teacher. A spy. A patriot.

Guards notice him approaching. One speaks into a radio.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Turns out none of it was real. Except maybe the teacher. That felt true.

He reaches the gate. Stops.

JAKE
(to the guard, out loud)
Jake Cooper. They're expecting me.

The guard checks a list. Nods.

GUARD
Right this way, Mr. Cooper.

The gate opens. Jake walks through.

JAKE (V.O.)
I don't know what happens next. I don't know who I'll become after they're done with me.

Final shot: Jake walking toward the embassy doors. Behind him, Seoul sprawls - neon signs, crowded streets, a city of millions going about their day.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
But for the first time in my life, whoever I become - that's going to be my choice.

He reaches the door. Pauses. Takes one last look at Seoul.

Then he walks inside.

The door closes behind him.

> FADE TO BLACK.
