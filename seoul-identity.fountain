# ACT ONE

## SEQUENCE 1 - TWO FACES

= Jake Cooper leads a double life in 1993 Seoul - beloved English teacher by day, CIA operative by night. We establish both identities before they begin to collide.

INT. KOREAN LANGUAGE SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

[[Scene 1: Opening Image - Warm afternoon light through windows, 1993 Seoul]]

A modest classroom. Posters of American landmarks line the walls. A chalkboard reads: "ENGLISH CONVERSATION - INTERMEDIATE."

JAKE COOPER, 23, American, stands at the front with easy confidence. Button-down shirt, sleeves rolled up. He looks more like a grad student than a spy.

Six KOREAN STUDENTS, ages ranging from teens to middle-aged, watch him attentively.

JAKE
(in perfect Korean)
Okay, everyone. Today we practice asking directions. But first--

He switches to English, gesturing dramatically.

JAKE (CONT'D)
Only English from now on. No Korean. Even if it hurts.

The students laugh nervously. An OLDER WOMAN, 50s, raises her hand.

OLDER WOMAN
(heavy accent)
Teacher... what if we don't know the word?

JAKE
Then you find another way. Use your hands. Draw a picture. Act it out.

He mimes being lost, spinning in circles, looking confused. More laughter.

JAKE (CONT'D)
In America, nobody cares if your grammar is perfect. They care if you try.

A TEENAGE BOY in the back looks skeptical.

TEENAGE BOY
You speak Korean very good. How long you study?

JAKE
(beat, then warm smile)
A long time. And I made many, many mistakes. Still do.

He moves to the chalkboard, writes: "EXCUSE ME, WHERE IS THE SUBWAY?"

JAKE (CONT'D)
Now. Everyone repeat after me...

INT. KOREAN LANGUAGE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - LATER

[[Scene 2: End of day, golden hour light through windows]]

Students file out. Jake stands at the classroom door, saying goodbye to each one.

JAKE
(to Older Woman)
Your pronunciation is getting much better, Mrs. Park.

She beams, bowing slightly. Jake returns it naturally.

The Teenage Boy hangs back. Approaches Jake hesitantly.

TEENAGE BOY
Teacher... why you come to Korea? Why not stay in America?

Jake's smile flickers - just for a moment. Then it's back.

JAKE
Sometimes the best opportunities are far from home.

The boy nods, not quite satisfied, and leaves.

Jake watches him go. His expression shifts - the warmth fading into something harder, more watchful. He checks his watch.

INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - EVENING

[[Scene 3: Small studio, careful organization beneath surface clutter]]

A different Jake. Same face, different energy.

He stands at a desk covered with papers, photographs, a MAP of Seoul with pins and thread connecting locations. A shortwave RADIO crackles with static in the corner.

Jake studies a photograph: a Korean man in a business suit, entering a building. He flips it over - handwritten notes in code.

His fingers tap the desk rhythmically. Nervous habit.

The radio crackles. Jake crosses to it, adjusts the dial.

VOICE (V.O.)
(through static, coded)
Songbird, confirm receipt. Package ready for collection.

Jake picks up the receiver.

JAKE
(flat, operational)
Songbird confirms. Location Charlie, 2300.

He clicks off. Stands motionless for a moment.

Then he crosses to a closet. Pushes aside teacher clothes to reveal: dark jacket, black jeans, running shoes. A small PISTOL in a hidden compartment.

He stares at the gun. Doesn't take it. Closes the closet.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(to himself, quietly)
Just a pickup. In and out.

He grabs the dark jacket. His teacher's smile is long gone.

EXT. KOREAN LANGUAGE SCHOOL - DAY

[[Scene 4: THE CATALYST - Harsh morning light, tension building]]

Jake approaches the school. Something's wrong. TWO BLACK SEDANS parked at odd angles. A small crowd of STUDENTS gathered outside, murmuring.

MRS. PARK (the older woman from class) spots Jake. Rushes to him.

MRS. PARK
(panicked, in Korean)
Teacher! Men inside - they have Mr. Choi!

JAKE
(sharp)
What men? How many?

MRS. PARK
Three. Maybe four. They say school owes money.

Jake's jaw tightens. He scans the building. Calculating.

JAKE
Go home. All of you. Now.

He moves toward the entrance. Mrs. Park grabs his arm.

MRS. PARK
Teacher, no - they have guns!

Jake gently removes her hand. His eyes have changed - the teacher is gone.

JAKE
(quiet, flat)
I know.

INT. KOREAN LANGUAGE SCHOOL - MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 5: Dim interior, shafts of light through dirty windows]]

Jake enters quietly. Moves through the hallway with trained precision - back to wall, checking corners. Nothing like a teacher.

Voices from the director's office. Angry Korean. A man pleading.

Jake pauses outside the door. Listens.

THUG #1 (O.S.)
...last warning. The money, or we take something more valuable.

MR. CHOI (O.S.)
(desperate)
Please - I don't have it. Give me one more week--

The sound of a SLAP. Mr. Choi cries out.

Jake's hand moves to the door handle. Stops.

This isn't his fight. He should walk away. Call in a report. Stay in cover.

Another SLAP. A woman SCREAMS - a secretary, maybe.

Jake closes his eyes. Opens them. Decision made.

He pushes open the door.

INT. DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 6: Cramped office, four men, one weapon visible]]

MR. CHOI, 60s, school director, cowers behind his desk. Blood on his lip. His SECRETARY huddles in the corner.

THREE THUGS in cheap suits. THUG #1 holds a pistol loosely at his side. THUG #2 has brass knuckles. THUG #3 guards the door - which Jake just came through.

Everyone freezes.

JAKE
(calm, in Korean)
I'm looking for the restroom. Wrong door.

He starts to back out. Thug #3 blocks him.

THUG #1
(sneering)
The American teacher. I heard about you.

JAKE
I'm nobody. I teach English. That's all.

Thug #1 steps closer. Studies Jake's face.

THUG #1
You teach English. But you move like a soldier.

Beat. Jake's mask slips - just for a second.

THUG #1 (CONT'D)
Who are you really?

JAKE
(flat)
Someone you should let walk away.

Thug #1 LAUGHS. Raises his pistol toward Jake.

What happens next takes three seconds.

Jake catches Thug #1's wrist, twists, strips the gun. Elbow to Thug #2's throat. Thug #3 rushes him - Jake sidesteps, uses momentum to slam him into the wall.

All three thugs down. Jake stands over them, breathing hard, holding the pistol professionally. Finger off trigger. Barrel down.

Mr. Choi stares, mouth open.

MR. CHOI
How did you--

JAKE
(cutting him off)
Call the police. Tell them it was a robbery. You fought them off.

MR. CHOI
But--

JAKE
(harder)
You fought them off. Understand?

Jake looks at the pistol in his hand. The thugs groaning on the floor. His cover - six months of careful work - evaporating.

He sets the gun on the desk. Starts for the door.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(to himself)
Damn it.

EXT. KOREAN LANGUAGE SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

[[Scene 7: Jake exits, crowd has dispersed]]

Jake emerges into bright daylight. Pauses. Looks up.

Across the street, a BLACK SEDAN. Tinted windows. Watching.

Jake doesn't run. Doesn't hide. He walks toward it.

The rear window rolls down. MR. KIM, 50s, severe face, sits in the back seat. Cold eyes assess Jake.

MR. KIM
(in English, perfect diction)
That was impressive, Mr. Cooper. Reckless. But impressive.

JAKE
Who are you?

MR. KIM
Someone who's been watching you for a long time.

Jake's fists clench at his sides.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
Don't worry. I'm not here to expose you. Quite the opposite.

He gestures to the empty seat beside him.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
Get in. We have much to discuss.

JAKE
And if I don't?

MR. KIM
(cold smile)
Then your Agency will receive an interesting report about their asset's... extracurricular activities.

Beat. Jake looks back at the school. At the life he just burned.

He gets in the car.

The sedan pulls away.

EXT. SEOUL MARKET - NIGHT

[[Scene 8: Wide shot, low-key neon lighting]]

A bustling night market. Neon signs flicker. Vendors shout. Steam rises from food stalls.

Jake weaves through the chaos, slightly out of focus against the vivid backdrop. He moves cautiously, glancing at stalls, slipping through crowds.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

[[Scene 5: Low-angle shot, moonlight with artificial light]]

Jake stands on the edge of a rooftop, facing an UNKNOWN MAN dressed in black. Wind blows through Jake's hair.

## SEQUENCE 2 - THE CONTACT

= Jake meets Mr. Han and receives information that will change everything.

INT. SMALL CAFE - NIGHT

[[Scene 6: Two-shot from side, low warm lighting]]

A dimly lit corner table. MR. HAN, Korean, 50s, slides a FOLDER across the table to Jake.

INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

[[Scene 7: Overhead shot, dim table lamp]]

The folder from Mr. Han spread across Jake's desk. PHOTOGRAPHS and DOCUMENTS scattered.

Jake leans heavily over the desk, shuffling the photographs. He stops at one particular photo, his face tightening with realization.

INT. SEOUL SUBWAY STATION - DAY

[[Scene 8: Wide shot, harsh fluorescent lighting]]

A bustling subway station. Jake stands among commuters, nervously scanning for anyone following him.

He pushes through the crowd, occasionally looking back. Stops briefly at a map display, glances over his shoulder, then moves again.

EXT. SEOUL STREETS - NIGHT

[[Scene 9: Handheld side shot, low-key lighting]]

A narrow alleyway. Jake runs, looking back to see the shadow of his PURSUER gaining on him.

EXT. SEOUL PARK - NIGHT

[[Scene 10: Medium shot, flickering street lamp]]

= Jake flees through Seoul's underbelly, leading to his first direct confrontation.

INT. SEWER SYSTEM - NIGHT

[[Scene 11: Low-angle tracking shot, flashlight beam]]

INT. SEWER INTERSECTION - NIGHT

[[Scene 12: Close-up alternating shots, flashlight illumination]]

Jake reaches an intersection. Comes face-to-face with his pursuer. The atmosphere thick with tension, echoes amplifying their voices.

EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY

[[Scene 13: Wide shot from behind, natural daylight]]

Jake emerges from a manhole onto a busy street, blending with the crowd. The city alive with honking cars and bustling people.

INT. SUNG-HO'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY

[[Scene 14: Medium close-up from inside, warm interior lighting]]

They share a brief, intense look. Sung-ho pulls Jake inside, closing the door behind them.

INT. SUNG-HO'S APARTMENT - DAY

[[Scene 15: Over-the-shoulder shot, warm dim lighting]]

Jake and Sung-ho sit on the floor around a low table. SOJU bottles between them. Documents spread across the table.

INT. SUNG-HO'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 18: Medium shot, low warm lighting]]

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

[[Scene 20: Over-the-shoulder shot, flashlight and moonlight]]

Jake meets the Unknown Man in the middle of the warehouse. They exchange a BRIEFCASE, each looking distrustful.

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 21: Handheld shaky medium shot, rolling flashlight]]

An ATTACKER bursts from behind a crate. Jake barely dodges the first blow. The Unknown Man drops the briefcase. Chaos erupts.

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 22: Tracking shot from behind, dynamic lighting]]

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - WINDOW - NIGHT

[[Scene 23: Low-angle shot from outside, streetlamp and moonlight]]

He reaches the window, pushes until it cracks, squeezes through, drops, rolls to avoid injury.

EXT. BACKSTREET - NIGHT

[[Scene 24: Medium side shot, mixed lighting]]

Jake stumbles out and leans against a brick wall, catching his breath. Pedestrians walk by, unaware.

EXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT

[[Scene 25: Low-angle close-up, flickering overhead light]]

Jake ducks into a narrow alley, crouching beside old crates. He pulls a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket.

= Jake reviews his intel and notices something that doesn't add up. The first crack in his certainty.

INT. SUBURBAN HOME - KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)

[[Scene 26: Medium shot, warm morning light]]

YOUNG JAKE, teenage, sits at a kitchen table with his MOTHER. They discuss an opportunity in Korea. His mother looks worried but supportive.

MOTHER
You're sure this is what you want? It's so far away.

YOUNG JAKE
It's a chance to be someone, Mom. To matter.

She places her hand gently on his arm.

MOTHER
You already matter. You know that, right?

Young Jake looks away. He doesn't believe her.

INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (PRESENT)

[[Scene 27: MIDPOINT REVERSAL - Single lamp, shadows, revelation]]

Jake sits on the floor surrounded by documents. The folder from Mr. Han. Photos. The intel from his Agency contacts. Reports from Mr. Kim.

He's cross-referencing. Something bothers him.

JAKE
(muttering)
This doesn't make sense.

He holds up two photographs side by side. The SAME MAN - but one photo is labeled as a North Korean agent, the other as a South Korean asset.

JAKE (CONT'D)
Wait...

He shuffles through more papers. Finds a date discrepancy. An operation report claims Jake delivered a package on March 3rd. But he was in the hospital that day. Food poisoning. He remembers it clearly.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(growing alarm)
I wasn't even there. I was sick. Who...

His phone RINGS. Jake freezes. Stares at it.

It rings again. He answers.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(cautious)
Yeah?

MR. KIM (V.O.)
(filtered)
Mr. Cooper. I trust you received the updated intelligence.

JAKE
I'm looking at it now.

MR. KIM (V.O.)
Good. The target will be at the location tomorrow night. Don't be late.

Jake looks at the contradicting photos.

JAKE
Who verified this intel?

Silence on the line.

MR. KIM (V.O.)
(colder)
That's not your concern. Your concern is completing the mission.

JAKE
I'm asking because something doesn't--

MR. KIM (V.O.)
(sharp)
Questions are dangerous, Mr. Cooper. Especially the wrong ones.

CLICK. Line goes dead.

Jake stares at the phone. Then at the documents.

JAKE
(quietly, to himself)
What the hell is going on?

He looks at the map on his wall. All those pins. All those connections. What if they're wrong? What if they've always been wrong?

His fingers start tapping the floor. Nervous habit.

For the first time since he arrived in Seoul, Jake Cooper doesn't know what's true.

## SEQUENCE 7 - THE RIVER

= Jake and Sung-ho plan their next move by the Han River.

EXT. HAN RIVERBANK - NIGHT

[[Scene 28: Wide shot, city lights reflecting]]

= They reach temporary safety and plan the final confrontation.

EXT. HIDDEN SAFEHOUSE - INDUSTRIAL AREA - NIGHT

[[Scene 34: Medium shot, flickering overhead bulb]]

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 58: Medium close-up, diffused natural light]]

Jake grabs the LEAD PURSUER by the collar. Slams him against a crate.

JAKE
Who sent you? Was it Kim? The Agency?

The pursuer - we'll call him AGENT PARK - LAUGHS. Blood on his teeth.

AGENT PARK
(in Korean)
You still don't understand, do you?

JAKE
English. Now.

AGENT PARK
(switching, amused)
Your Korean is better than mine. But okay, Mr. Cooper. English it is.

He looks at Jake with something like pity.

AGENT PARK (CONT'D)
You want to know who sent us? Everyone did. That's the joke.

SUNG-HO
(weapon trained)
Jake. We don't have time for this.

JAKE
(ignoring him, to Agent Park)
Explain.

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 59: ALL IS LOST - Close-up on Jake, half-lit face]]

Agent Park leans back against the crate. Resigned. Almost relieved.

AGENT PARK
You think you've been working for the CIA. Running operations against North Korean assets.

JAKE
I have been.

AGENT PARK
(shaking head)
You've been running errands for Mr. Kim. Who works for Pyongyang. Every "mission" you completed - you were helping the other side.

Jake's grip loosens slightly. Agent Park sees it.

AGENT PARK (CONT'D)
The information you gathered? Went north. The packages you delivered? Helped identify South Korean agents. Three of them are dead because of you.

JAKE
(barely audible)
That's not possible. My handler--

AGENT PARK
Your "handler" at the Agency? He doesn't exist. The drop points, the coded messages - all routed through Kim's network.

Jake releases him. Steps back. The gun in his hand suddenly feels impossibly heavy.

JAKE
I was vetted. Trained. I've been filing reports for two years--

AGENT PARK
Reports to who? Did you ever see your control officer in person?

Silence. Jake didn't. He never did. It was always calls. Dead drops. Encrypted messages.

AGENT PARK (CONT'D)
Your entire identity was manufactured, Cooper. The "CIA agent" cover? That was Kim's operation. You're not a double agent who got caught - you were never on our side to begin with.

Jake staggers. Catches himself on a crate.

SUNG-HO
(confused, in Korean)
Jake? What is he saying?

Jake can't answer. Can't breathe.

AGENT PARK
The worst part? You believed it. Every mission, every dead drop, every night pretending to be a spy - you thought you were the hero.

(beat)

You were the weapon. Pointed at your own country.

Jake's world collapses. Everything he thought he knew. Every sacrifice. Every choice.

A lie.

JAKE
(broken, almost a whisper)
Who am I?

Agent Park actually looks sad.

AGENT PARK
That's the question, isn't it?

Jake stands motionless. The gun hangs at his side. Sung-ho calls his name but Jake can't hear him.

The teacher. The spy. The patriot.

All masks. And underneath - nothing he recognizes.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - BACK ALLEY - DAWN

[[Scene 60: Dark Night of Soul - First light, Jake broken]]

Jake stumbles out the back door. Sung-ho follows, confused and worried.

SUNG-HO
(in Korean)
Jake! What happened in there? What did he tell you?

Jake doesn't answer. Keeps walking. Reaches a wall. Stops.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
Talk to me. Whatever it is--

JAKE
(flat, hollow)
I'm not who I thought I was.

SUNG-HO
What does that mean?

Jake turns. His face is devastated.

JAKE
Everything I've done. Every mission. Every risk you took helping me. I was working for the wrong side. The whole time.

Sung-ho processes this.

SUNG-HO
North Korea?

Jake nods.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
(long pause)
Did you know?

JAKE
No. But does that matter? People are dead because of me. South Korean agents. Our side.

SUNG-HO
It matters.

Jake looks at him.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
A weapon doesn't choose who fires it. You were aimed. That's not the same as choosing to pull the trigger.

JAKE
That's not--

SUNG-HO
(cutting him off)
What you did before - that's over. The question is what you do now.

Jake stares at the ground. The weight of everything pressing down.

JAKE
I don't know who I am anymore. The teacher was a cover. The spy was a lie. What's left?

Sung-ho steps closer. Puts his hand on Jake's shoulder.

SUNG-HO
(simple, direct)
What's left is a man standing in an alley, deciding who he wants to be.

Beat. Jake looks up.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
You have information about Kim's network. You know how he operates, who his contacts are. That's worth something to the right people.

JAKE
I don't know who the right people are. I don't know who to trust.

SUNG-HO
Then trust yourself. Decide what's right. Do that.

Jake looks at the rising sun. The first real light touching Seoul's skyline.

INT. PHONE BOOTH - MORNING

[[Scene 61: CLIMAX - Jake makes his choice]]

Jake stands in a cramped phone booth. Receiver pressed to his ear.

OPERATOR (V.O.)
United States Embassy, how may I direct your call?

Jake hesitates. His finger hovers over the disconnect button.

Then:

JAKE
I need to speak with the Regional Security Officer. My name is Jake Cooper. I'm an American citizen. And I have information about a North Korean intelligence operation targeting US assets in South Korea.

Long pause.

OPERATOR (V.O.)
Please hold, Mr. Cooper.

Jake exhales. He's chosen.

JAKE
(to himself, quiet)
Okay. New game. New rules.

He looks out the phone booth window at Seoul waking up around him.

JAKE (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Still here.

EXT. STREETS OF SEOUL - MORNING

[[Scene 62: Jake moves through the city]]

Jake walks through morning crowds. Business people. Students. Vendors opening shops.

For the first time, he's not hiding. Not performing. Just walking.

He passes a school. Pauses. Watches children file inside.

The teacher in him - maybe that part was real too.

EXT. HAN RIVER - CONTINUOUS

[[Scene 63: Jake and Sung-ho part ways]]

Jake meets Sung-ho at the riverbank. The same spot from before, but different light. Different man.

SUNG-HO
The embassy?

JAKE
They want to meet. Debrief everything I know about Kim's operation.

SUNG-HO
And then?

JAKE
I don't know. Maybe home. Maybe somewhere else. Somewhere I can start over.

Sung-ho nods.

SUNG-HO
You're welcome here. You know that.

JAKE
(small smile)
In Korea, or in your apartment?

SUNG-HO
(returning the smile)
Both. Neither has hot water, but the company is good.

They share a moment. Two men who found something real amid all the deception.

JAKE
I'll find you. When this is over.

SUNG-HO
I know.

They clasp hands. Brief but meaningful.

Sung-ho walks away. Doesn't look back.

EXT. US EMBASSY - MORNING

[[Scene 64: FINAL IMAGE - Jake approaches the embassy]]

Jake stands across the street from the US Embassy. An imposing building. The American flag catching morning light.

Inside: questions. Debriefs. Consequences.

But also: truth. Finally.

He straightens his shirt. Runs a hand through his hair. Old habit from teaching - looking presentable.

JAKE
(V.O.)
My mother asked me once if I knew who I was. I didn't. Not then.

He steps off the curb. Starts walking toward the entrance.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I spent two years in Seoul pretending to be someone I wasn't. A teacher. A spy. A patriot.

Guards notice him approaching. One speaks into a radio.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Turns out none of it was real. Except maybe the teacher. That felt true.

He reaches the gate. Stops.

JAKE
(to the guard, out loud)
Jake Cooper. They're expecting me.

The guard checks a list. Nods.

GUARD
Right this way, Mr. Cooper.

The gate opens. Jake walks through.

JAKE (V.O.)
I don't know what happens next. I don't know who I'll become after they're done with me.

Final shot: Jake walking toward the embassy doors. Behind him, Seoul sprawls - neon signs, crowded streets, a city of millions going about their day.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
But for the first time in my life, whoever I become - that's going to be my choice.

He reaches the door. Pauses. Takes one last look at Seoul.

Then he walks inside.

The door closes behind him.

> FADE TO BLACK.
