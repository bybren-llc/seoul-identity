## Storyline

In 1993 Seoul, Jake Cooper leads a double life: beloved English teacher by day, CIA operative by night. When his cover is blown during a violent confrontation at his language school, Jake discovers a terrifying truth—he's been working for the wrong side all along.

Recruited by a man he believed to be CIA, Jake spent two years running missions he thought served his country. But the intelligence he gathered went north. The packages he delivered exposed South Korean agents. Three are already dead.

With his identity shattered and both sides hunting him, Jake must decide who he really is—and who he wants to become. His only ally is Sung-ho, an old friend with a dangerous past, who believes the man beneath all the masks is still worth saving.

A twisting spy thriller about loyalty, deception, and the terrifying question: what happens when everything you believed about yourself turns out to be a lie?

## Plot Summary

Jake Cooper, a 23-year-old American teaching English in Seoul, secretly works as a CIA operative—or so he believes. When thugs threaten his language school, Jake's combat training is exposed, catching the attention of the mysterious Mr. Kim.

As Jake investigates discrepancies in his missions, he uncovers evidence that his "CIA handler" doesn't exist. The drops, the coded messages, the intelligence he gathered—all routed through a North Korean network run by Kim. Jake isn't a double agent who got caught. He was never on America's side to begin with.

Hunted by Kim's operatives and questioning everything he thought he knew, Jake turns to Sung-ho, a Korean friend whose sister Jake once saved. Together they navigate Seoul's underworld, gathering proof of Kim's operation while staying one step ahead of the kill teams.

In a final confrontation, Jake must choose: disappear into a new life, or walk into the US Embassy and face the consequences of missions he never meant to complete. He chooses truth—the first real choice he's ever made.
