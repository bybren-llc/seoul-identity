# Character Arc Analysis: SEOUL IDENTITY

## Overview

This document maps the transformation arcs for all significant characters in "Seoul Identity." Character arcs are analyzed using the Want/Need framework, tracking how each character changes (or fails to change) across the three-act structure.

**Core Thematic Question:** "Who do I want to be?"

---

## Primary Characters

### Jake Cooper (Protagonist)

**Role:** American CIA agent, undercover as English teacher
**Age:** 23
**First Appearance:** Scene 1 (Lines 19-66)

#### Want vs. Need
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **WANT** | To be a competent CIA operative, to serve his country, to matter |
| **NEED** | To discover his authentic identity, to choose who he wants to be |
| **LIE** | "I know who I am and who I work for" |
| **TRUTH** | Identity is a choice, not an assignment |

#### Arc Transformation Points

**ACT ONE: The Mask**
| Scene | Lines | Arc Moment | Transformation |
|-------|-------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | 19-66 | Opening Image | Jake performs warmth, competence, cultural fluency - all masks |
| 3 | 98-127 | Apartment reveal | Secret life shown - camera, classified materials - dual identity established |
| 4 | 129-163 | Catalyst | Combat skills exposed - first mask slips |
| 6 | 186-262 | Skills revealed | Jake demonstrates he's more than a teacher - identity fractures |

**ACT TWO: The Cracks**
| Scene | Lines | Arc Moment | Transformation |
|-------|-------|------------|----------------|
| 10 | 419-555 | Theme Stated | Mr. Han poses the question Jake will carry: "Who do I want to be?" |
| 14 | 705-739 | B Story begins | Reunion with Sung-ho - first authentic relationship |
| 27 | 1457-1528 | Midpoint | Discovery of date discrepancies - "I wasn't even there" - Jake's operational identity begins to collapse |
| 30-33 | 1611-1798 | Han River | Crossing = metaphor for transition; Jake moves from known to unknown territory |

**ACT THREE: The Choice**
| Scene | Lines | Arc Moment | Transformation |
|-------|-------|------------|----------------|
| 59 | 2803-2877 | All Is Lost | Agent Park's revelation - Jake learns he's been a North Korean asset; entire identity destroyed |
| 60 | 2878-2957 | Dark Night | "Who am I?" - Jake stripped to nothing; Sung-ho offers lifeline |
| 61 | 2959-2991 | Break Into Three | Jake calls embassy - chooses to face truth rather than run |
| 64 | 3049-3102 | Final Image | Walking into embassy - first truly authentic choice of the story |

#### Arc Trajectory
```
MASKS -----> CRACKS -----> COLLAPSE -----> CHOICE
  |            |             |              |
Teacher    Skills        "I was         "Whoever I
CIA Agent  revealed    working for    become - that's
Competent  Reports     the wrong     going to be
           don't match   side"       my choice"
```

#### Arc Score: 7/10

**Strengths:**
- Clear thematic through-line
- Strong opening/closing image contrast
- Emotional payoff in Dark Night scene
- Physical journey (Han River crossing) mirrors internal journey

**Weaknesses:**
- Jake is mostly reactive throughout Acts One and Two
- Few moments where Jake actively drives the plot
- Limited interiority - we see what happens to him, not his processing
- The transformation feels compressed in Act Three
- Missing: scenes of Jake questioning before the revelation

#### Recommendations for Story Architect
1. Add internal conflict scenes in Act Two where Jake questions his mission
2. Give Jake more agency - let him make choices that advance the plot
3. Consider flashbacks to recruitment that plant seeds of doubt
4. Extend Dark Night sequence for deeper emotional processing

### Mr. Kim (Handler/Potential Mentor)

**Role:** Jake's Korean handler
**Age:** 50s
**First Appearance:** Scene 5 (Lines 165-185)
**Last Appearance:** Scene 7 (Lines 264-308)

#### Want vs. Need
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **WANT** | To control Jake, to run his operation |
| **NEED** | Unknown - character underdeveloped |
| **LIE** | Presents himself as ally/mentor |
| **TRUTH** | True allegiance never confirmed |

#### Arc Analysis

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** Mr. Kim disappears after Scene 7 (approximately page 10). He is introduced as a significant figure - someone who has been "watching" Jake, who knows about his "extracurricular activities," and who gets Jake into his car. Then he vanishes.

**Scenes Present:**
| Scene | Lines | Content |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 5 | 165-185 | First appearance, watching Jake |
| 7 | 264-308 | Gets Jake into car, implies knowledge of Jake's activities |

**After Scene 7:** No further appearances in the screenplay.

#### Arc Score: 2/10

**Critical Problems:**
- No arc - character simply disappears
- Set up as mentor/handler but never pays off
- No confrontation with Jake when truth is revealed
- Role seems to be absorbed by Agent Park (who delivers the revelation)
- Violation of promise to audience - significant introduction with no follow-through

#### Recommendations for Story Architect
1. Mr. Kim must return for Act Three confrontation
2. Clarify his true allegiance (North Korean? Double agent? CIA?)
3. Consider making him the one who delivers the "All Is Lost" revelation
4. Add scenes in Act Two showing his manipulation
5. Final confrontation where Jake must face his handler

---

### Aaron (Antagonist/False Ally)

**Role:** American operative, false ally to Jake
**Age:** 30s
**First Appearance:** DOES NOT APPEAR IN SCREENPLAY

#### CRITICAL OMISSION

Aaron is prominently featured in the source materials:
- SEOUL_IDENTITY_LOGLINE.pdf lists him as a key character
- Described as "American operative who turns out to be false ally"
- Age 30s, should serve as mirror/foil to Jake

**Aaron is completely absent from the current screenplay.**

This is a significant structural problem. The source materials suggest Aaron serves crucial functions:
1. False friendship that deepens Jake's paranoia
2. American-to-American betrayal (more personal than Korean handlers)
3. Mirror character - what Jake could become
4. Raises stakes of "who can I trust?"

#### Arc Score: 0/10 (Character missing)

#### Recommendations for Story Architect
1. **HIGH PRIORITY:** Add Aaron to the screenplay
2. Position introduction in Act One as fellow American Jake trusts
3. Use Aaron for exposition about mission/stakes
4. Aaron's betrayal could be the Midpoint or All Is Lost catalyst
5. Consider Aaron as final confrontation antagonist

---

### Sung-ho (B Story/Friend)

**Role:** Jake's Korean friend from the past
**Age:** 40s
**First Appearance:** Scene 14 (Lines 705-739)

#### Want vs. Need
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **WANT** | To help his friend Jake |
| **NEED** | To see Jake as a person, not an operative |
| **LIE** | None - Sung-ho is the truth-teller |
| **TRUTH** | "What's left is a man standing in an alley, deciding who he wants to be" |

#### Arc as Thematic Guide

Sung-ho carries the B Story and, more importantly, carries the theme. He functions as Jake's conscience and the voice of authenticity.

**Key Scenes:**
| Scene | Lines | Function |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 14 | 705-739 | Reunion - introduces authentic relationship |
| 15-18 | 740-888 | Planning - Sung-ho shows practical loyalty |
| 28-29 | 1530-1610 | Han River meeting - commits to helping Jake |
| 30-33 | 1611-1798 | River crossing - physical journey together |
| 60 | 2878-2957 | **CRUCIAL:** Provides thematic resolution |

#### The Sung-ho Moment (Scene 60)

This is the most important character moment in the screenplay:

```
SUNG-HO
Jake. Look at me.

Jake looks up. Tears in his eyes.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
You were a piece on a board. That's
over. What's left is a man standing
in an alley, deciding who he wants
to be.
```

Sung-ho reframes Jake's entire crisis. Rather than "who was I working for," the question becomes "who do I want to be."

#### Arc Score: 6/10

**Strengths:**
- Clear function as B Story
- Carries theme effectively
- Provides authentic relationship Jake needs
- Crucial role in Dark Night of Soul

**Weaknesses:**
- Introduction feels late (Scene 14)
- Relationship history told, not shown
- Limited characterization beyond "loyal friend"
- We don't know what Sung-ho wants for himself

#### Recommendations for Story Architect
1. Introduce Sung-ho earlier (perhaps Scene 5-7)
2. Add flashback showing their history
3. Give Sung-ho his own want/need beyond helping Jake
4. Consider what Sung-ho risks by helping Jake

## Supporting Characters

### Mr. Han (Contact)

**Role:** Mysterious contact who provides exposition
**First Appearance:** Scene 10 (Lines 419-555)

**Function:** Mr. Han delivers the theme statement and significant exposition about the intelligence landscape. He asks Jake the crucial question: "Who do I want to be?"

**Issues:**
- Heavy exposition scene (Cafe, Scene 10)
- Appears once, disappears
- Unclear allegiance and motivation

**Arc Score:** 3/10 - Functions as exposition device rather than character

---

### Agent Park

**Role:** Delivers the All Is Lost revelation
**First Appearance:** Scene 59 (Lines 2803-2877)

**Function:** Agent Park is the one who tells Jake the truth - that he's been a North Korean asset since day one.

**Issues:**
- Introduced late only to deliver devastating news
- No prior relationship with Jake
- Could this role be given to Mr. Kim for greater impact?

**Arc Score:** 2/10 - Plot device, not character

---

### Mrs. Park (School Director)

**Role:** Director of the language school
**First Appearance:** Scene 2 (Lines 68-96)

**Function:** Establishes Jake's cover, provides initial ordinary world context.

**Issues:**
- Minimal presence after setup
- Potential for deeper relationship unexplored

**Arc Score:** 3/10 - Setup only

---

### Mr. Choi

**Role:** Target of thugs' threats
**First Appearance:** Scene 4 (Lines 129-163)

**Function:** Catalyst for Jake revealing his combat skills.

**Arc Score:** 2/10 - Plot device only

2. Bring Mr. Kim back for Act Three confrontation
3. Give Jake more active choices throughout

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**

## Notes for Dialogue Writer

When developing character voices:
- **Jake:** Controlled, professional surface; vulnerability breaks through in key moments
- **Sung-ho:** Warm, direct, cuts through Jake's defenses
- **Mr. Kim:** (If developed) Should be authoritative, slightly threatening, paternal
- **Aaron:** (When added) Should mirror Jake's American qualities, making betrayal personal
- **Mr. Han:** Enigmatic, philosophical, speaks in questions

Each character should have distinct speech patterns that reflect their relationship to truth and identity - the core theme of the screenplay.
