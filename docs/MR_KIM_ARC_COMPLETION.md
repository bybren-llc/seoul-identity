# Mr. Kim Arc Completion

**Agent:** Story Architect
**Date:** 2026-01-15
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** APPROVED FOR EXECUTION

---

## Executive Summary

Mr. Kim is Jake's handler and the architect of his false identity. Currently, he appears in Scenes 7 and 27 (phone only), then vanishes from the narrative entirely, becoming merely a topic of conversation. This document designs his complete arc, transforming him from a plot device into Jake's thematic antagonist who embodies the question: "Can identity be chosen, or is it assigned by others?"

---

## 1. Character Analysis

### 1.1 Current Presence

| Scene | Type | Content |
|-------|------|---------|
| 7 | Physical | Black sedan, recruits Jake with blackmail |
| 27 | Voice only | Phone call, warns Jake about asking questions |
| 10 | Reference | Mr. Han shows photo in North Korean uniform |
| 59 | Reference | Agent Park reveals Kim's network |

**Problem:** Mr. Kim disappears after Scene 27. The man who created Jake's false identity never confronts the man who discovers the truth.

### 1.2 Character Definition

**Role:** Handler, architect of deception, false father figure

**Surface Identity:**
- South Korean intelligence officer
- Professional, controlled, slightly paternal
- Claims to be protecting Jake's CIA cover

**True Identity:**
- North Korean asset (former military intelligence)
- Mercenary operator - "serves the highest bidder"
- Created Jake's entire false reality

**Relationship to Jake:**
Mr. Kim is a **dark mirror** of Jake himself. Both men wear masks. Both operate through deception. But where Jake was an unknowing victim, Mr. Kim chose this life deliberately. He represents what Jake could become if he embraces cynicism over truth.

**Why He Chose Jake:**
- Jake was recruited young (college) - malleable, idealistic
- American identity provides perfect cover for moving intelligence
- Jake's genuine belief in his CIA mission made him more effective
- Kim needed someone who could pass CIA verification - Jake's sincerity was undetectable because it was real

**True Allegiance:**
Mr. Kim has no allegiance except to power and survival. He served North Korea because they paid well. He would serve anyone. This mercenary amorality makes him more terrifying than a true believer - he destroyed Jake's life for money, not ideology.

### 1.3 Voice and Manner

- Speaks English with "perfect diction" - trained, deliberate
- Cold assessment mode - "Cold eyes assess Jake"
- Occasional paternal warmth (false) - "Don't worry"
- Threatening when challenged - "Questions are dangerous"
- Never raises voice - control is power

**Speech Pattern Examples:**
- "That was impressive, Mr. Cooper. Reckless. But impressive."
- "Someone who's been watching you for a long time."
- "Questions are dangerous, Mr. Cooper. Especially the wrong ones."

## 2. Arc Design

### 2.1 Complete Journey Map

| Act | Scene | Function | Status | Content Summary |
|-----|-------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| One | 7 | Introduction | EXISTING | Black sedan recruitment - establishes power dynamic |
| Two | 27 | Manipulation | EXISTING | Phone call - shuts down Jake's questions |
| Two | 33A | Pressure | **NEW** | Physical check-in - tests Jake's loyalty |
| Two | 45-area | Setup | REVISION | Plant seeds for Act 3 confrontation |
| Three | 59 | Revelation | **REWRITE** | Mr. Kim delivers All Is Lost (replaces Agent Park) |
| Three | 61B | Confrontation | **NEW** | High Tower Surprise - final face-off |

### 2.2 Thematic Progression

1. **Act One (Scene 7):** Mr. Kim as AUTHORITY - Jake accepts the role given to him
2. **Act Two (Scene 27, 33A):** Mr. Kim as QUESTIONER - pressure reveals cracks
3. **Act Three (Scene 59, 61B):** Mr. Kim as MIRROR - Jake must reject the identity Kim assigned

---

## 3. Key Questions Resolved

### Q1: Is Mr. Kim North Korean, CIA, or something else?

**Answer:** North Korean military intelligence background, but currently a **mercenary freelancer**.

**Narrative Justification:**
Mr. Han's line establishes this: "Mr. Kim works for the people who pay him most. Today, that is Pyongyang. Tomorrow, who knows? Loyalty is expensive. He sells to the highest bidder."

This makes Mr. Kim more disturbing than a true believer. He didn't betray Jake for ideology - he did it for money. Jake's entire existence was a business transaction.

### Q2: Does he know about Aaron?

**Answer:** Yes - Mr. Kim planted Aaron.

**Narrative Justification:**
If Aaron is added as a false ally/American operative (per the Rewrite Execution Plan), Mr. Kim should be his handler too. This:
- Explains how Aaron found Jake
- Creates dramatic irony when Jake confides in Aaron
- Makes Mr. Kim's network feel comprehensive
- Raises stakes when Aaron's betrayal is revealed

**Note for Aaron integration:** In Scene 33A, Mr. Kim could subtly reference "your American friend" to create unease without explicit revelation.

### Q3: Why does he deliver the All Is Lost revelation?

**Answer:** Because he CREATED Jake's identity. Only the architect can fully demolish the structure.

**Narrative Justification:**
Agent Park can tell Jake facts: "You've been working for North Korea."
Mr. Kim can destroy Jake's soul: "I made you. Every belief, every mission, every moment of pride - I designed it. You are my creation."

The revelation is more devastating from the creator than from an observer. Mr. Kim's presence forces Jake to look at the man who shaped his entire adult identity.

### Q4: What happens in the confrontation - physical or psychological?

**Answer:** **Primarily psychological, with physical tension.**

**Narrative Justification:**
The theme is "Who do I want to be?" - not "Who can win a fight?" A physical victory would be hollow. Jake must defeat Mr. Kim by choosing who he is, not by overpowering him.

**Structure:**
- Mr. Kim intercepts Jake en route to the embassy
- He offers Jake a new identity, a new mission (temptation)
- He threatens exposure, imprisonment, death (coercion)
- Jake refuses - not through violence but through choice
- Physical standoff resolves through Jake walking away

### Q5: What is his fate at the end?

**Answer:** **Left alive, neutralized by Jake's choice.**

**Narrative Justification:**
Jake choosing to walk into the embassy - exposing everything - destroys Mr. Kim's network more effectively than killing him would. Kim's fate is left ambiguous: hunted by his own people for failure, or absorbed into another network.

His survival also leaves room for sequel potential without requiring it.

## 4. Scene Designs

### 4.1 Scene 33A: Mr. Kim Check-in (NEW)

**Location:** INT. TEA HOUSE - PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT

A traditional Korean tea house with low tables, paper screens. Intimate. Controllable. Mr. Kim's territory.

**Purpose:**
- Reestablish Mr. Kim as physical presence
- Test Jake's loyalty after Mid-point questioning (Scene 27)
- Plant seeds of doubt about Jake's investigation
- Escalate threat level

**What Mr. Kim Wants:**
- Confirm Jake hasn't been turned
- Deliver new "mission" parameters
- Assess Jake's psychological state
- Warn without revealing too much

**What Jake Learns:**
- Mr. Kim knows about his contact with Mr. Han (surveillance is total)
- The network is larger than he imagined
- Questions have consequences

**Tension Point:**
Mr. Kim knows something is wrong with Jake but can't determine exactly what. Jake must lie to the man who taught him to lie.

**Page Target:** 2 pages

**Scene Structure:**

```
BEAT 1: Arrival
- Jake enters, Mr. Kim already seated
- Tea poured - ritual, controlled
- Small talk masks assessment

BEAT 2: Interrogation (veiled)
- Mr. Kim asks about Jake's "state of mind"
- References seeing Jake "near Itaewon" (where Mr. Han met him)
- Jake realizes he's been watched

BEAT 3: The Test
- Mr. Kim gives Jake a new assignment
- Target: a South Korean businessman (actually a loyalist)
- "Your commitment has seemed... uncertain lately"

BEAT 4: Escalation
- Jake asks neutral question about the target
- Mr. Kim's demeanor chills
- "I'm giving you an opportunity to demonstrate where your loyalties lie"

BEAT 5: Exit
- Mr. Kim leaves first
- Line: "I've invested a great deal in you, Mr. Cooper. Don't make me regret it."
- Jake sits alone, understanding the threat
```

### 4.2 Scene 59: All Is Lost (REWRITE)

**Current Scene:**
Agent Park delivers the revelation to Jake in the warehouse after capture.

**Revised Scene:**
Mr. Kim himself emerges from the shadows to deliver the truth.

**Why Mr. Kim Instead of Agent Park?**

| Element | Agent Park Version | Mr. Kim Version |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Information source | Secondhand - Park learned from intel | Primary - Kim designed the operation |
| Emotional impact | Devastating | Soul-crushing |
| Power dynamic | Stranger exposing Jake | Father figure destroying child |
| Theme connection | External revelation | Internal reckoning |

**What Specifically Does He Reveal?**

1. Jake's "CIA recruitment" was a North Korean operation from day one
2. His handler at Langley doesn't exist - all communications routed through Kim's network
3. Every mission helped identify and eliminate South Korean assets
4. The documents Jake discovered were meant to be found - a test of loyalty he failed
5. Mr. Kim's final card: "I made you. Every belief you held, I put there."

**How Does Jake React?**

Three stages:
1. **Denial:** "That's not possible. My handler--"
2. **Realization:** The evidence he's gathered suddenly recontextualizes
3. **Collapse:** "Who am I?" - directed at Kim, the architect

**Why Is This More Devastating From Mr. Kim?**

Agent Park is a stranger. He can state facts.

Mr. Kim is the AUTHOR. He can narrate the creation:
- "That first day at the language school - you thought you were so careful. I was watching before you even knew there was a game."
- "Your pride in the mission. Your dedication. Your honor. I gave you all of that. None of it was yours."
- "You're not a traitor, Jake. That would require you to have ever belonged to something real."

**Page Target:** 4 pages

**Scene Structure:**

```
SETUP:
- Scene begins as currently written (Agent Park captured)
- Jake demands answers about who sent them

TURN:
- Voice from shadows: "I did."
- Mr. Kim emerges
- Agent Park's demeanor changes - he's afraid of Kim too

REVELATION (Extended):
- Kim dismisses Agent Park ("Leave us")
- Kim and Jake alone
- Kim reveals truth piece by piece
- Uses Jake's own evidence to prove it

DEVASTATION:
- Kim's final blow: "Who am I?"
- Jake's identity completely shattered
- Kim offers Jake a choice: "Come back. Or die a lie."
- Jake can't respond

EXIT:
- Kim leaves Jake broken in the warehouse
- "You have until dawn to decide what you are."
- Jake alone with impossible truth
```

### 4.3 Scene 61B: High Tower Surprise (NEW)

**Location:** EXT. STREET NEAR US EMBASSY - MORNING

One block from the embassy gates. Close enough to see the American flag. Far enough that Kim's men control the space.

**How Does Mr. Kim Intercept Jake?**

Black sedan appears - the same vehicle from Scene 7, visual callback. Kim's men create a perimeter. Jake is surrounded but not restrained. Kim wants a conversation, not a capture.

**What Does Mr. Kim Want?**

1. **Primary:** Recruit Jake back into the network
   - "You've seen the truth. Both sides use people. At least with me, you know the terms."

2. **Secondary:** Prevent Jake from reaching the embassy
   - "What will you tell them? That you were fooled? They won't believe you're innocent. You'll spend years in interrogation rooms."

3. **Tertiary:** Kill Jake if necessary
   - "I'd rather not. You were my best work."

**What Does Jake Want?**

- To reach the embassy (external)
- To prove he's more than Kim's creation (internal)
- To choose his own identity for the first time

**Is This Physical or Psychological Confrontation?**

**Both, but primarily psychological.**

Physical elements:
- Kim's men visibly armed
- Jake carries no weapon (discarded spy gear per Scene 61A)
- Tension of potential violence

Psychological elements:
- Kim offers Jake a way out of consequences
- Kim threatens exposure, imprisonment
- Kim challenges Jake's self-concept
- Jake must find conviction he's never had

**How Does It Resolve?**

**Jake walks away.**

Not through fighting. Not through clever escape. He simply chooses.

Kim's power was always psychological. He controlled Jake through false identity. When Jake rejects that identity, Kim has nothing left.

```
MR. KIM
You'll never be free of this. Wherever you go, you're still my creation.

JAKE
Maybe. But what I do next - that's mine.

He walks toward the embassy.

MR. KIM
(calling after)
They'll lock you in a room for years. They'll never trust you.

Jake doesn't stop.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
(final, quiet)
I made you, Jake.

JAKE
(not turning back)
And I'm unmaking myself.
```

Kim could order Jake shot. But killing Jake proves nothing. Letting him go might still be salvaged. Or perhaps Kim sees something in Jake he respects - a choice he never made himself.

**Page Target:** 4 pages

**Scene Structure:**

```
BEAT 1: Interception
- Jake walking toward embassy
- Black sedan appears
- Visual callback to Scene 7

BEAT 2: The Offer
- Kim emerges
- Offers Jake return to the network
- "You know too much about both sides now. That makes you valuable."

BEAT 3: The Threat
- Jake refuses
- Kim threatens embassy: "You'll be a prisoner there too"
- Kim threatens violence: "Or we end this differently"

BEAT 4: The Challenge
- Kim questions Jake's identity: "Who are you without me?"
- Jake must answer - not for Kim, but for himself

BEAT 5: The Choice
- Jake rejects both Kim's offer and his threats
- He walks toward the embassy
- Kim could stop him but doesn't

BEAT 6: Final Exchange
- Jake's back to Kim
- Kim's final line acknowledges defeat/respect
- Jake reaches the embassy gate
```

## 5. Dialogue Templates

### 5.1 Scene 33A: Pressure Moment

**Mr. Kim's assessment of Jake's state:**
```
MR. KIM
You seem distracted, Mr. Cooper. Unfocused. That concerns me.

JAKE
I'm fine.

MR. KIM
(cold smile)
Men who are fine don't wander through Itaewon at odd hours. Don't meet with strangers in coffee shops.
(beat)
I see everything, Jake. That's what keeps you alive.
```

**The veiled threat:**
```
MR. KIM
I've invested considerable resources in you. Training. Cover. Protection. That investment requires returns.
(pause)
Don't make me question whether the investment was sound.
```

### 5.2 Scene 59: Revelation

**Mr. Kim's entrance:**
```
AGENT PARK
You want to know who sent us? Everyone--

MR. KIM (O.S.)
I did.

Jake spins. Mr. Kim emerges from the shadows. Same cold eyes. Same severe face. Same perfect diction.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
Hello, Jake. We need to talk about who you really are.
```

**The core revelation:**
```
MR. KIM
Your handler at Langley - describe him to me. His voice. His manner. The way he ends calls.

Jake opens his mouth. Closes it. He's never met the man. Never even video called.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
Because there is no handler. There never was. Every instruction, every drop point, every coded message - routed through my network. You've been working for Pyongyang since the day you arrived in Seoul.

JAKE
(barely audible)
That's not possible. I was vetted. Trained--

MR. KIM
By me. Through intermediaries. Your idealism was... perfect. You believed so completely. That belief made you invisible to everyone looking for doubt.
(almost proud)
You were my masterpiece.
```

**The devastating blow:**
```
JAKE
Who am I?

MR. KIM
(simply)
You're no one. The teacher - a cover. The spy - a lie. The patriot - a performance.
(beat)
Everything you thought you were, I put there. You're not a person, Jake. You're a tool I designed.
```

### 5.3 Scene 61B: Confrontation Climax

**Kim's final offer:**
```
MR. KIM
Come back. I'll give you a new identity. A new purpose. You know both sides now - that makes you invaluable.

JAKE
You mean it makes me a better tool.

MR. KIM
(shrugging)
Everyone uses everyone, Jake. At least I'm honest about it.
```

**Jake's rejection:**
```
JAKE
You didn't make me. You just... pointed me in the wrong direction.

MR. KIM
I created your beliefs. Your values. Your--

JAKE
No. You exploited them. There's a difference.
(beat)
The part of me that wanted to do right? That was mine. You just lied about what right looked like.
```

**Final exchange:**
```
MR. KIM
(as Jake walks away)
I made you.

JAKE
(not turning)
And I'm unmaking myself. Whatever comes next - that's mine.

He keeps walking. Kim watches him go.

MR. KIM
(quiet, to himself)
Interesting.

He gets in the car. The sedan pulls away - in the opposite direction.
```

### 5.4 His Final Line

**Option A - Grudging respect:**
```
MR. KIM
(watching Jake enter the embassy)
Interesting.
```

**Option B - Acknowledgment of defeat:**
```
MR. KIM
(to his driver, as Jake disappears inside)
Pull the network. Seoul is burned.
```

**Option C - Ambiguous threat/promise:**
```
MR. KIM
(last look at the embassy)
We'll see who you become, Jake Cooper. We'll see.
```

**Recommended:** Option A. Simple. Suggests Mr. Kim sees something unexpected in Jake - genuine agency. Leaves door open without sequel-baiting.

## 6. Thematic Function

### 6.1 How Does Mr. Kim Serve "Who Do I Want to Be?"

Mr. Kim represents **assigned identity**. He is the ultimate authority figure who defines Jake's reality - his beliefs, his missions, his self-concept. Everything Jake thought he was came from Kim's design.

Jake's arc is about rejecting assigned identity and choosing his own. Mr. Kim is the embodiment of what Jake must reject.

### 6.2 What Does He Represent About Identity?

**Mr. Kim's worldview:** Identity is assigned by power. We are what others make us. Jake was "made" to be an asset - that is his identity, whether he chose it or not.

**Jake's counter-argument:** Identity is chosen through action. What we do next matters more than what was done to us. Jake can reject his manufactured past by choosing his authentic future.

The confrontation between Jake and Kim is really about whether identity is:
- **Fixed** (you are what you were made to be)
- **Fluid** (you are what you choose to become)

### 6.3 How Does Confronting Him Help Jake's Arc?

Jake cannot complete his arc without confronting Mr. Kim directly. Here's why:

1. **Scene 7 (Beginning):** Jake accepts the identity Kim assigns
2. **Scene 59 (All Is Lost):** Jake learns the identity was false
3. **Scene 61B (Climax):** Jake rejects Kim's claim to define him

If Jake never faces Kim again, he's rejecting an abstraction. By confronting the actual architect of his false self, Jake rejects the PERSON who claimed to make him.

The physical confrontation makes the internal victory concrete.

### 6.4 Mirror or Contrast to Jake's Choice?

**DARK MIRROR.**

Mr. Kim represents what Jake could become:
- Someone who defines others' identities
- Someone who serves power without conviction
- Someone who treats identity as a tool, not a truth

By rejecting Kim, Jake rejects that possible self.

**The key distinction:**
- Mr. Kim chose deception knowingly
- Jake was deceived without knowledge
- Kim has no authentic self - only masks
- Jake, in choosing truth, creates an authentic self

When Jake walks away from Kim toward the embassy, he's choosing truth over deception - the opposite of Kim's entire life.

## 7. Integration Notes

### 7.1 Aaron Integration (if implemented)

If Aaron is added as the false American ally, Mr. Kim should:
- Be Aaron's handler (revealed in Act 3)
- Reference "your American friend" in Scene 33A
- Possibly use Aaron's betrayal as additional devastation in Scene 59

### 7.2 Continuity Considerations

- Black sedan should be visually consistent (callback value)
- Mr. Kim's costume: dark suit, conservative, no flash
- His English: "perfect diction" - maintain formal speech patterns
- Physical demeanor: controlled, unhurried, never raises voice

### 7.3 Page Budget

| Scene | Current | Added | Total |
|-------|---------|-------|-------|
| 33A | 0 | +2 | 2 |
| 59 | 3 | +1 | 4 |
| 61B | 0 | +4 | 4 |
| **Total** | 3 | +7 | 10 |

---

## 8. Authorization

**Story Architect Sign-off:** APPROVED FOR EXECUTION

**Dependencies:**
- Aaron Character Bible must clarify if Aaron connects to Mr. Kim
- Scene Writer to execute scenes with Dialogue Writer polish

**Next Step:** Scene Writer to draft Scene 33A
