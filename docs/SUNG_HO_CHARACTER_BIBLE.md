## 1. Character Profile

### Basic Information

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Sung-ho (surname not established; common Korean naming: Park Sung-ho, Kim Sung-ho, or Lee Sung-ho would fit) |
| **Age** | 40s (approximately 42-45) |
| **Nationality** | South Korean |
| **Background** | Former ROK Army; unclear current employment (possibly runs small business or works trades) |
| **Family** | Wife (referenced); younger sister (rescued by Jake in 1991); wife's cousin (fish market accountant, mistakenly identified as "Sparrow" in Jake's intelligence) |
| **Relationship to Jake** | Closest friend; met in 1991 when Jake helped extract his sister from North Korean cultivation |
| **Years Knowing Jake** | 2 years (since 1991) |

### Physical Description

Sung-ho presents as a working-class Korean man with weathered dignity - someone who has seen enough to be careful but remains fundamentally decent:

- **Build:** Sturdy, practical; the physique of someone who works with his hands or did physical labor in youth
- **Height:** Average Korean male height
- **Face:** Weathered, lined with experience; eyes that have seen hard things but remained kind
- **Hair:** Black with early gray; cut practically, not fashionably
- **Dress:** Simple, practical clothing - the uniform of Seoul's working class in the early 1990s
- **Apartment:** Small, cluttered with books and newspapers; a photo of his sister on a shelf; evidence of a woman's presence (his wife)
- **Distinguishing marks:** Steady hands; unhurried movements; the patience of someone who has learned to wait

### Defining Characteristics

1. **The Truth-Teller:** Sung-ho cuts through Jake's defenses and pretenses. "I believed you believed it" - he knew Jake was in some kind of trouble from the start but remained loyal anyway. His function is to speak truth when Jake needs to hear it.

2. **Practical Loyalty:** Sung-ho's friendship isn't sentimental. He provides safe houses, tactical knowledge, local connections. He stays with Jake through a night of psychological collapse, but he also brings rice and kimchi because "eat, then we talk."

3. **Moral Anchor:** When Jake breaks down - "Jake Cooper doesn't exist" - Sung-ho responds with grounded reality: "You're sitting in an alley. I can see you. You exist." His worldview is concrete, not abstract.

4. **Military Background:** Sung-ho served in the ROK Army. He tells a story about a compromised intelligence operation that killed three men. He knows about classified information, surveillance, the wages of bad intelligence. He's not naive about Jake's world.

5. **The Friend Who Stays:** Most would walk away when they learn their friend was an unwitting North Korean asset. Sung-ho stays. "You were lied to. Same as me." His continued friendship is Jake's lifeline.

## 2. Psychology

### Want (Conscious Goal)
Sung-ho wants **to help his friend Jake survive the crisis**. In Act Two, this means planning operations, providing local knowledge, offering safe haven. In Act Three, this means simply staying present while Jake processes impossible truth.

### Need (Underlying Character Truth)
**To see Jake as a person, not an operative.** Sung-ho's gift to Jake is treating him as a human being first. When everyone else sees Jake through the lens of his cover or his betrayal, Sung-ho sees the man who stayed late to teach a child to write.

### The Lie Sung-ho Rejects
Sung-ho doesn't carry a lie in the traditional arc sense - he's a flat arc character who helps Jake transform. But he does reject Jake's self-condemnation: **"I'm nothing. I was never real."**

Sung-ho's counter: *"Only real things can break."*

### The Truth Sung-ho Carries
**"What you do next belongs to you."**

This is the thematic heart of the screenplay, and Sung-ho delivers it. The past was lies, manipulation, unwitting betrayal. But the future is choice. Whatever Jake was made into, what he does now is his.

Sung-ho's key speech:
> "You were a piece on a board. That's over. What's left is a man standing in an alley, deciding who he wants to be."

### The Ghost (Backstory)

**The Army Incident:**
Sung-ho served in the ROK Army. During his service, a man in his unit followed orders perfectly, delivered intelligence reports, did his duty - and three men died because the intelligence was compromised.

That soldier killed himself. Sung-ho remembers him, thinks about whether it was the right choice. It wasn't. "His death didn't save anyone. It just gave them one more victim."

This story isn't just background - it's Sung-ho's gift to Jake. When Jake is contemplating the weight of four dead agents, Sung-ho offers an alternative to suicide or self-destruction: survive, and make the people actually responsible answer for it.

**The Sister:**
Two years ago, Sung-ho's younger sister was being cultivated by North Korean intelligence. She worked at the National Assembly, had access to committee schedules. An older man was grooming her.

Jake appeared with a photograph and a warning. He helped extract her - new job, new city, new identity. Why? "Because no one should be used like that. Turned into something they didn't choose."

That moment created their friendship. Not debt - Sung-ho tried to frame it as debt. Jake refused: "I don't want a debt. I want a friend. Someone real. In a city full of lies."

## 3. Character Voice

### Speech Patterns

Sung-ho's dialogue shifts between Korean and English, often reflecting emotional register:

| Context | Language | Pattern | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Greeting** | Korean | Warm, familiar | "야! 이 미친 자식아." (*Ya! You crazy bastard.*) |
| **Serious discussion** | English | Direct, practical | "Stop apologizing. Tell me what happened." |
| **Emotional peaks** | Korean | Raw, intimate | "친구가 되는 건 빚을 갚는 것보다 어려워." (*Being a friend is harder than repaying a debt.*) |
| **Tactical planning** | English | Precise, knowledgeable | "Building next door. Older. Worse security. Roof access connects through a maintenance hatch." |
| **Comforting** | Both | Simple, grounded | "Whatever it is. Whatever he told you. You're still here. I'm still here." |

### Verbal Tics and Habits

- **Code-switching:** Moves between Korean and English fluidly, using Korean for emotional intimacy
- **Directness:** Doesn't soften hard truths - "Sorry doesn't fix stupid"
- **Practical focus:** "Eat. Then we talk." "Drink the water."
- **"Hyung" reference:** Calls Jake "hyung" despite Jake being younger - term of respect and affection
- **Silence as tool:** Comfortable with silence; doesn't fill gaps with nervous chatter

### What Sung-ho Talks About

- Practical matters (food, safety, planning)
- Jake's past kindnesses (teaching the child, saving the sister)
- Stories from his own experience (army incident)
- Direct questions that cut to the heart
- What Jake can do next

### What Sung-ho Avoids Talking About

- Abstract philosophy (he's concrete, not theoretical)
- His own feelings beyond basic expressions
- Judgment of Jake's choices
- False comfort or easy reassurance
- The broader politics (he cares about people, not systems)

### Sample Characteristic Dialogue

**Reunion - warm and sharp:**
> (in Korean)
> 야! 이 미친 자식아.
> *Ya! You crazy bastard.*
>
> (switching to English)
> Two years. Two years, no word. Now you knock on my door in daylight?

**Cutting through defenses:**
> I believed you believed it.

**Practical care:**
> When did you last eat?
>
> (bringing food)
>
> Eat. Then we talk.

**Grounding truth:**
> You're sitting in an alley. I can see you. You exist.

**The thematic key:**
> You were a piece on a board. That's over. What's left is a man standing in an alley, deciding who he wants to be.

**On survival vs. death:**
> His death didn't save anyone. It just gave them one more victim.

## 4. Arc Design

### Arc Type: Flat (Positive Influence)

Sung-ho does not transform; he enables Jake's transformation. He enters the story with clear values and maintains them through the crisis. His consistency is what makes him useful - Jake needs a fixed point while his world spins apart.

### Act Two: The Anchor

| Scene | Position | Function | Key Moments |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **14** | Introduction | B-Story begins | Reunion; "Two years, no word"; establishes authentic relationship |
| **14A** | Flashback | History | Shows how they met; Jake saved Sung-ho's sister; friendship forged |
| **15-18** | Planning | Alliance | Sung-ho provides safe haven, local knowledge, practical help |
| **16** | Discovery | Reality check | Photos of "targets" are innocent people Sung-ho knows |
| **28-29** | Han River | Commitment | Sung-ho commits to helping despite escalating danger |
| **30-33** | River crossing | Physical journey | Together they move from known territory to unknown |

**Act Two Sung-ho:** Practical ally providing concrete help. He gives Jake shelter, food, tactical knowledge. But he also begins asking the questions Jake can't answer: "Gave who?" "What the hell is going on?"

### Act Three: The Lifeline

| Scene | Position | Function | Key Moments |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **59** | Warehouse | Witness | Present when Mr. Kim reveals truth; sent outside |
| **60** | Dark Night I | First response | Rushes to Jake; witnesses physical collapse |
| **60-II** | Dark Night II | Story | Tells army story - the soldier who killed himself |
| **60-III/IV** | Dark Night III/IV | Vigil | Stays through the night; blanket, water, cigarettes |
| **60A** | Dark Night V | Key speech | "Only real things can break" - validates Jake's humanity |
| **61+** | Resolution support | Continued presence | Stays with Jake through the choice |

**Act Three Sung-ho:** Carries the Dark Night of the Soul. His presence, his story, his key lines provide Jake the lifeline to survive the revelation. He doesn't fix anything - he just stays.

### Sung-ho's Key Thematic Moment

Scene 60-III/IV contains Sung-ho's most important contribution:

> "A weapon doesn't sit in an alley crying. A tool doesn't feel sick when it learns what it was used for. You're broken, Jake. Completely shattered.
>
> (beat)
>
> But only real things can break."

This line validates Jake's humanity precisely when Mr. Kim's revelation threatens to erase it. Kim claimed he "made" Jake - that even Jake's conscience was designed. Sung-ho counters: the breaking itself proves Jake is real.

---

## 5. Integration Guidelines

### Relationship to Jake

**Surface Dynamic:** Friend from a shared history. Sung-ho owes Jake for saving his sister; their bond is forged in crisis.

**True Dynamic:** Jake's only authentic relationship. In a city of lies, masks, and manufactured identities, Sung-ho is real. He knew Jake was in some kind of trouble and befriended him anyway. His friendship isn't transactional - it's the thing Jake needs most.

**Key Tension:** When Jake learns he was a North Korean asset, he expects Sung-ho to abandon him. Sung-ho stays: "You were lied to. Same as me." The tension isn't whether Sung-ho will leave - it's whether Jake can accept that anyone would stay.

**Dialogue guidance:**
- Sung-ho should be more direct than anyone else in Jake's life
- He cuts through Jake's self-pity without being cruel
- His silences are as important as his words
- He uses Jake's name rarely - when he does, it matters
- His Korean to Jake signals emotional intimacy

### Relationship to Mr. Kim

Sung-ho and Mr. Kim should ideally never meet directly, or only briefly. They represent opposite poles of Jake's experience:

| Mr. Kim | Sung-ho |
|---------|---------|
| Manufactured relationship | Authentic relationship |
| American (Aaron) as false ally | Korean as true friend |
| Speaks to control | Speaks to connect |
| Claims to have made Jake | Witnesses who Jake really is |

**If They Must Meet:**
In Scene 59, Sung-ho is sent outside before Kim's revelation. He witnesses Kim's arrival, sees Agent Park's fear, but doesn't hear the devastating truth directly. His response to Jake afterward is based on Jake's broken state, not full knowledge.

### Relationship to Aaron

Sung-ho and Aaron should be kept separate, emphasizing their contrast:

- Aaron is Jake's false American friend
- Sung-ho is Jake's real Korean friend
- Aaron manipulates through shared nationality ("we Americans")
- Sung-ho connects through genuine care

**If They Meet:**
Sung-ho should immediately distrust Aaron. His instincts should ping: "That American. His eyes don't match his smile." This could plant seeds for later revelation.

### Key Scenes Where Sung-ho MUST Appear

1. **Scene 14 (Reunion):** Establish the relationship and his character
2. **Scene 14A (Flashback):** Show how they met, why Jake is trusted
3. **Scene 16 (Discovery):** Reality check - targets are innocent people he knows
4. **Scene 60 (Dark Night):** Stay with Jake through the collapse
5. **Scene 60-III/IV (Key speech):** Deliver "only real things can break"

### Subtext Guide

| Sung-ho Says | Sung-ho Means |
|--------------|---------------|
| "You crazy bastard." | "I missed you." |
| "Sorry doesn't fix stupid." | "I'm worried about you." |
| "I believed you believed it." | "I always knew something was wrong." |
| "Eat. Then we talk." | "I'm going to take care of you." |
| "You exist." | "You're not what they made you." |
| "Only real things can break." | "Your pain proves your humanity." |
| "What you do next - that belongs to you." | "Choose who you want to be." |

---

### Flashback - The Beginning (Scene 14A)

*1991. Sung-ho's apartment, two years earlier.*

**SUNG-HO**
(in Korean)
당신도 누군가에게 이용당했어?
*Someone used you too?*

*Jake doesn't answer. Doesn't have to.*

**SUNG-HO (CONT'D)**
(deciding)
If you help my sister... I will owe you. A debt I cannot repay.

**JAKE**
I don't want a debt. I want a friend.
(beat)
Someone real. In a city full of lies.

**SUNG-HO**
(raising soju glass)
친구가 되는 건 빚을 갚는 것보다 어려워.
*Being a friend is harder than repaying a debt.*

---

### Cutting Through Defenses (Scene 15)

*Present day. Jake explains his situation.*

**JAKE**
I've been in Seoul two years. You know what I do.

**SUNG-HO**
I know what you told me. CIA. Intelligence work. "Making a difference."

*There's something in his tone. Jake catches it.*

**JAKE**
You didn't believe me?

**SUNG-HO**
I believed you believed it.

---

### Dark Night - Grounding (Scene 60)

*The alley. Jake broken.*

**JAKE**
(hollow laugh that's more like a sob)
I'm not here. I was never here. Jake Cooper doesn't exist.

**SUNG-HO**
You're sitting in an alley. I can see you. You exist.

**JAKE**
(turning to face him, eyes wild)
Everything I've done. Every mission. Every risk you took helping me--

He can't finish.

**SUNG-HO**
(waiting until it passes)
Tell me. All of it.

---

### The Key Speech (Scene 60-III/IV)

*Hours later. Sung-ho with cigarette.*

**SUNG-HO**
A weapon doesn't sit in an alley crying. A tool doesn't feel sick when it learns what it was used for. You're broken, Jake. Completely shattered.
(beat)
But only real things can break.

---

### What You Do Next (Scene 60A)

*Night. Jake considering running.*

**JAKE**
I keep thinking about running. Getting on a plane. Going somewhere no one knows me.

**SUNG-HO**
You could.

**JAKE**
But I'd still be me. Still be... this.
(beat)
There's no starting over when you're built on a lie.

**SUNG-HO**
Or maybe you burn it down. And find out what's underneath.

---

## Appendix A: Sung-ho's Key Props

- **Soju bottles:** Present in every scene at his apartment; ritual of sharing, offering comfort
- **Photograph of sister:** On shelf; reminder of what Jake did for him, why he trusts
- **Blanket:** Draped over Jake during the night vigil; practical care made physical
- **Cigarettes:** Smoked during the Dark Night scenes; something to do while waiting

## Appendix B: Sung-ho's Cultural Authenticity Notes

**Korean Male Friendship (1990s context):**
- Physical contact less common than Western friendships, but when used, it's meaningful
- Directness is respect - softening truth would be condescending
- Sharing food and drink is intimate; offering soju is offering connection
- "Hyung" from Jake (younger) to Sung-ho (older) is normal; from Sung-ho to Jake is respect for what Jake did for the family

**Code-Switching:**
- Korean for emotional intimacy, family matters, genuine feeling
- English for tactical discussion, practical planning
- The shift itself signals emotional register

**Working-Class Seoul:**
- Small apartments, cluttered but functional
- Community knowledge (neighbors notice American visitors)
- Practical resourcefulness (knows alternate routes, building layouts)

## Appendix C: Thematic Function

Sung-ho serves the screenplay's central theme of **identity and choice** in three ways:

1. **Authentic Relationship:** In a story about manufactured identities, Sung-ho represents something real. His friendship wasn't assigned, programmed, or manipulated. He chose Jake, and keeps choosing him even when the truth is revealed.

2. **The Voice of Theme:** Sung-ho delivers the screenplay's central message directly: "What's left is a man standing in an alley, deciding who he wants to be." He doesn't philosophize - he speaks from experience, from presence, from staying.

3. **Contrast to False Community:** Aaron offers "we Americans" - shared nationality as manipulation. Sung-ho offers genuine friendship across cultural lines. The Korean friend is real; the American "friend" is false. Identity isn't nationality - it's choice.

---

## Appendix D: Development Notes

Sung-ho's existing documentation in CHARACTER_ARCS.md notes that his Want/Need could be developed beyond "help Jake." This bible offers one approach:

**Sung-ho's Hidden Stake:**
His wife's cousin was identified as "Sparrow" in Jake's intelligence. If Jake's missions helped identify South Korean agents... could Sung-ho's family be implicated? This creates stakes beyond friendship.

**Sung-ho's Own Question:**
The army story suggests Sung-ho has thought about these questions before. He chose to live with impossible knowledge rather than die from it. His wisdom isn't abstract - it's earned.

**What Sung-ho Risks:**
By helping Jake, Sung-ho risks his own safety, his family's safety, his standing in a society that doesn't forgive association with foreign intelligence. His loyalty is costly.
