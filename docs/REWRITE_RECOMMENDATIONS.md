---

## Priority Classification

| Priority | Definition | Action Timeline |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| **P1 - Critical** | Structural problems that break the story | Immediate |
| **P2 - Important** | Significant issues affecting quality | Before next draft |
| **P3 - Enhancement** | Improvements that elevate the material | As time permits |

---

## CRITICAL FIXES (P1)

### P1.1: Add Aaron Character

**Agent:** Story Architect (structure), Scene Writer (scenes), Dialogue Writer (voice)
**Impact:** Fills major gap in antagonist structure

**Background:** Aaron is prominently featured in source materials as an American false ally but is completely absent from the screenplay. His addition addresses multiple issues:
- Provides persistent antagonist presence
- Creates American-to-American betrayal (more personal)
- Offers mirror character for Jake's identity theme
- Enables midpoint or climax betrayal

**Recommended Implementation:**

| Scene Position | Content | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|---------|
| Scene 3B (NEW) | Aaron visits Jake's apartment | Establish friendship |
| Scene 8B (NEW) | Aaron at night market with Jake | Deepen trust |
| Scene 15B (NEW) | Aaron provides "intel" to Jake | Set up betrayal |
| Scene 42 (NEW) | Aaron's betrayal revealed | Midpoint catalyst or BGCI escalation |
| Scene 58B (NEW) | Confrontation with Aaron | Climax sequence |

**Dialogue Notes for Aaron:**
- American accent, casual demeanor
- Should seem trustworthy - the betrayal must hurt
- Mirror Jake's speech patterns initially
- Post-betrayal: cold, professional, dismissive

---

### P1.2: Expand Act One Setup

**Agent:** Scene Writer (primary), Dialogue Writer (support)
**Impact:** Audience investment, proper pacing
**Current:** ~10 pages
**Target:** ~25 pages

**New Scenes Required:**

**Scene 1B: JAKE'S MORNING ROUTINE (NEW)**
- Location: INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING
- Content: Jake waking, Korean radio news, making Korean breakfast, checking dead drop instructions
- Purpose: Establish dual life routine before disruption
- Pattern: Discovery Scene (layered reveals)
- Length: 2 pages

**Scene 2B: JAKE AND STUDENTS (NEW)**
- Location: EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY
- Content: Jake eating lunch with students, speaking Korean, laughing, genuinely connecting
- Purpose: Show the mask Jake wears is partly real - he does care
- Pattern: Character Introduction scene
- Length: 1.5 pages

**Scene 3B: AARON INTRODUCTION (NEW)**
- Location: INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
- Content: Aaron drops by, they drink beer, discuss cover stories, share frustrations about "the job"
- Purpose: Establish Aaron as trusted friend/ally
- Pattern: Setup scene with planted betrayal seeds
- Length: 3 pages

**Scene 6B: JAKE'S INTERNAL DEBATE (NEW)**
- Location: INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
- Content: After Mr. Kim contact, Jake alone, examining documents, questioning
- Purpose: Show internal conflict, agency
- Pattern: Discovery Scene
- Length: 2 pages

**Dialogue Focus for New Act One Scenes:**
- Jake's voice should be warmer in teacher mode
- Professional distance with Aaron (but Aaron breaks it down)
- Internal questioning should be minimal dialogue - visual storytelling

---

### P1.3: Bring Mr. Kim Back / Final Confrontation

**Agent:** Story Architect (structure), Scene Writer (climax)
**Impact:** Antagonist resolution, proper climax
**Current Issue:** Mr. Kim disappears after Scene 7

**Recommended Fix:**

**Option A: Mr. Kim as Primary Antagonist**
Add scenes throughout:
- Scene 25B: Mr. Kim watching Jake from distance (visual only)
- Scene 38B: Mr. Kim meets Jake, gives false reassurance
- Scene 58: Mr. Kim confrontation replaces Aaron (if Aaron not added)
- Scene 63B: Final confrontation before embassy

**Option B: Mr. Kim as Revealer (if Aaron becomes primary antagonist)**
- Scene 59: Mr. Kim delivers the revelation (currently Agent Park)
- Scene 63B: Brief final exchange, Mr. Kim offers Jake a choice

**Recommended:** Option A - Mr. Kim should be the primary handler antagonist, with Aaron as the false ally betrayer.

**Confrontation Scene Template:**
```
INT. [LOCATION] - NIGHT

Jake faces Mr. Kim. Long beat.

MR. KIM
You finally understand.

JAKE
Who are you? Really?

MR. KIM
I'm the same person I've always been.
The question is - who are you?

Jake considers. The gun in his hand.

MR. KIM (CONT'D)
You could shoot me. Run to your embassy.
Tell them everything. But then what?
Who does Jake Cooper become?
```

### P1.4: Move All Is Lost Earlier

**Agent:** Story Architect
**Impact:** Proper pacing for Dark Night and Act Three
**Current Position:** Scene 59 (~page 93 relative)
**Target Position:** Scene 45-48 (~page 75)

**Restructure Required:**
1. Move Agent Park revelation to earlier sequence position
2. Extend Dark Night from current ~2 pages to ~5-7 pages
3. Create space for proper finale sequence

**Scene Reordering:**

| Current Scene | Current Position | New Position | Notes |
|---------------|------------------|--------------|-------|
| 59 (Revelation) | Scene 59 | Scene 48 | Move earlier |
| 60 (Dark Night) | Scene 60 | Scene 49-51 | Expand |
| 61 (Break Into 3) | Scene 61 | Scene 52 | Slight shift |
| 45-58 (current) | Before 59 | Reorder | Compress/combine |

---

### P1.5: Extend Dark Night of Soul

**Agent:** Scene Writer (primary), Dialogue Writer (Jake/Sung-ho)
**Impact:** Emotional depth, earned transformation
**Current:** ~2 pages (Scene 60)
**Target:** ~5-7 pages (Scenes 49-52)

**Current Scene 60 Analysis:**
The existing scene is strong but too brief. Sung-ho's line is perfect:
> "What's left is a man standing in an alley, deciding who he wants to be."

**Expansion Recommendations:**

**Scene 60A: THE COLLAPSE (EXTEND)**
- Jake's physical breakdown - vomiting, shaking
- Wordless moment of despair
- Visual: Jake literally on his knees
- Length: +1 page

**Scene 60B: SUNG-HO'S VIGIL (NEW)**
- Sung-ho stays with Jake through the night
- Minimal dialogue
- Dawn breaking
- Length: 2 pages

**Scene 60C: JAKE'S CHOICE (NEW)**
- Jake makes decision
- Physical action: stands up, cleans face, looks at Sung-ho
- The theme crystallizes
- Length: 1.5 pages

**Dialogue Notes:**
- Less is more in Dark Night
- Jake should have minimal dialogue - mostly physical acting
- Sung-ho's presence is the dialogue
- Final choice should be shown, not told

---

## IMPORTANT FIXES (P2)

### P2.1: Move Theme Statement Earlier

**Agent:** Dialogue Writer
**Impact:** Thematic clarity, audience engagement
**Current Position:** Scene 10, page ~18
**Target Position:** Page 5-7

**Options:**

**Option A: Echo Theme in Scene 3**
Add visual or brief dialogue when Jake examines his operational materials:
```
Jake stares at his reflection in the window. Two faces:
the teacher, the spy.

JAKE (V.O.)
(barely audible)
Who am I today?
```

**Option B: Flashback to Recruitment**
Add Scene 3C: Brief flashback to Jake's CIA recruitment where handler asks:
```
CIA HANDLER (V.O.)
The question isn't what you'll do for
your country. It's who you're willing
to become.
```

**Option C: Mrs. Park Dialogue (Scene 2)**
Have Mrs. Park say something thematic:
```
MRS. PARK
Jake, you seem different today.

JAKE
Different how?

MRS. PARK
Like you're not sure which version
of yourself to be.
```

**Recommended:** Option B or C - planting theme without heavy-handedness.

---

### P2.2: Escalate Bad Guys Close In

**Agent:** Scene Writer
**Impact:** Building tension toward All Is Lost
**Current Issue:** Stakes plateau in Scenes 34-44

**Scene-by-Scene Fix:**

| Scene | Current Issue | Fix |
|-------|---------------|-----|
| 34-35 | Repetitive planning | Combine, add threat |
| 36-37 | Movement without escalation | Add chase/near-miss |
| 38-39 | Stakes stagnant | Add casualty (contact killed?) |
| 40-41 | More planning | Delete or combine |
| 42-44 | Rooftop deal | Add betrayal element |

**New Scene Recommendation (Scene 38B):**
```
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

Jake and Sung-ho approach the contact point.

A BODY. Their contact. Dead.

SUNG-HO
We're too late.

In the dead man's hand: a note. Jake reads it.

JAKE
They know every move before we make it.

SUNG-HO
Then how do we--

JAKE
We don't. Not anymore.

(beat)

Unless we do something they can't predict.
```

This raises stakes and motivates Jake to take unexpected action.

---

### P2.3: Give Jake More Agency

**Agent:** Scene Writer (action), Dialogue Writer (decisions)
**Impact:** Protagonist engagement
**Current Issue:** Jake is acted upon rather than acting

**Agency Moments to Add:**

| Act | Scene Position | Agency Action |
|-----|----------------|---------------|
| One | Scene 6B | Jake chooses to investigate, not just follow orders |
| Two | Scene 22B | Jake sets a trap rather than being trapped |
| Two | Scene 35B | Jake makes tactical decision that proves effective |
| Three | Scene 58 | Jake confronts antagonist on his own terms |

**Dialogue Shift:**
Current Jake often says variations of "What do you want me to do?"
Revised Jake should say: "Here's what I'm going to do."

---

### P2.4: Introduce Sung-ho Earlier

**Agent:** Story Architect, Scene Writer
**Impact:** B Story strength, emotional investment
**Current Introduction:** Scene 14 (~page 23)
**Target Introduction:** Scene 5-7 (~page 8-10)

**Option A: Phone Call**
Add brief phone scene early:
```
INT. JAKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jake on phone, speaking Korean, laughing.

JAKE
(in Korean)
Sung-ho, I can't. Not this week.
(beat)
I know. I know. Soon. I promise.
```

**Option B: Photo/Memory**
Jake sees photo of himself with Sung-ho in apartment, establishing relationship visually.

**Option C: Brief Meeting**
Add scene where Jake and Sung-ho have quick coffee, establishing friendship before crisis.

**Recommended:** Option C - gives audience relationship to invest in.

---

### P2.5: Develop Supporting Characters

**Agent:** Dialogue Writer (primarily)
**Impact:** World building, emotional stakes

**Mr. Han (Scene 10):**
Current issue: Pure exposition delivery device
Fix: Add personal stake, quirk, or mystery
```
MR. HAN
(looking at old photograph)
I knew someone like you once. Bright.
Certain. He died certain.
(beat)
Certainty is a luxury you can't afford.
```

**Mrs. Park (Scenes 2, 5):**
Current issue: Functional only
Fix: Make her suspect something
```
MRS. PARK
Jake, you've been here three years.
I still don't know who you are.
(beat)
That's not a complaint. It's an observation.
```

**Agent Park (Scene 59):**
Current issue: Introduced only to deliver revelation
Fix: If keeping Agent Park, add brief earlier appearance so revelation has more weight. Or give revelation to Mr. Kim instead.

---

## ENHANCEMENT FIXES (P3)

### P3.1: Visual Motifs Throughout

**Agent:** Scene Writer
**Impact:** Thematic depth, visual cohesion

**Motif: Reflections/Mirrors**
Jake should encounter his reflection at key moments:
- Scene 3: Window reflection (identity question)
- Scene 27: Bathroom mirror (midpoint confusion)
- Scene 60: Puddle reflection (Dark Night)
- Scene 64: Embassy glass door (resolution)

**Motif: Doorways/Thresholds**
Jake physically crosses thresholds at decision points:
- Scene 7: Getting into Mr. Kim's car
- Scene 30-33: Han River crossing (existing, excellent)
- Scene 64: Embassy gates (existing, excellent)

---

### P3.2: Dialect and Voice Differentiation

**Agent:** Dialogue Writer
**Impact:** Character distinction, authenticity

**Voice Guidelines:**

| Character | Speech Pattern | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Jake (teacher mode) | Warm, patient, Korean phrases | "Let's try that again" |
| Jake (spy mode) | Clipped, professional | "Copy. Moving now." |
| Jake (authentic) | Uncertain, questions | "I don't know anymore" |
| Mr. Kim | Authoritative, enigmatic | Uses silence effectively |
| Sung-ho | Direct, warm, practical | Cuts through pretense |
| Aaron | Casual American, disarming | Mirror of Jake initially |
| Mr. Han | Philosophical, indirect | Questions, not answers |

---

### P3.3: Action Sequence Enhancement

**Agent:** Scene Writer
**Impact:** Genre satisfaction, pacing
**Pattern Reference:** `/patterns/scene-patterns.md` - Action Sequence

**Current Effective Sequences:**
- Sewer chase (Scenes 11-12)
- Warehouse confrontation (Scenes 19-25)
- Han River crossing (Scenes 30-33)

**Sequences Needing Enhancement:**

**Rooftop Scene (Scene 9):**
Currently feels static. Add:
- Physical danger (loose railing, wind)
- Time pressure (approaching patrol)
- Jake's athletic escape

**Final Act Action:**
Currently missing. Add:
- Chase sequence before confrontation
- Physical fight with Aaron or Mr. Kim's men
- Jake using skills he learned in Act One

---

### P3.4: Period Detail Enhancement (1993 Seoul)

**Agent:** Scene Writer, Research Specialist
**Impact:** Authenticity, world building

**Add:**
- Technology constraints (no cell phones, beepers, landlines)
- Political context references (North/South tensions)
- Economic boom markers (construction, growth)
- Cultural specifics (neon signs, street food, Hangul)

**Scene opportunities:**
- Jake using payphone (multiple scenes)
- Korean TV news in background
- Period-appropriate music
- Datemarked newspapers

## Dialogue Rewrite Notes

### Lines Needing Polish

**Scene 10 - Mr. Han's Exposition:**
Current issue: Too direct, too long
Fix: Add subtext, break with action
```
Current:
MR. HAN
You're being watched by North Korean
intelligence. They've been tracking
you since you arrived.

Revised:
MR. HAN
(pouring tea slowly)
Have you noticed the man at table four?

JAKE
The one who was here when I arrived?

MR. HAN
He's been here since you arrived.
In Korea. Three years ago.
```

**Scene 27 - Jake's Midpoint Realization:**
Current: "I wasn't even there. I was sick. Who..."
Fix: Less verbal, more physical reaction

**Scene 60 - Jake's Despair:**
Current: Works well
Note: Preserve Sung-ho's key line exactly

---

### Character Voice Adjustments

**Jake:**
- Reduce direct questions ("What's going on?")
- Add more internal conflict shown through hesitation
- Teacher Jake should have warmth; Spy Jake should be clipped

**Mr. Kim:**
- Add more silences in dialogue
- Should be threatening through calm, not aggression
- Every line should have double meaning

**Sung-ho:**
- Most authentic voice in script
- Preserve his directness
- Let him call out Jake's deflections

## Final Notes

The screenplay has strong bones: a clear theme, effective opening/closing images, authentic Korean setting, and an emotionally resonant B Story. The primary issues are structural (pacing, missing character, antagonist disappearance) rather than conceptual.

The core identity question - "Who do I want to be?" - is powerful and timely. The rewrite should amplify this question through:
- More scenes showing Jake's dual nature before revelation
- Aaron as mirror of what Jake could become
- Mr. Kim as representation of external identity assignment
- Sung-ho as voice of authentic choice

When Jake walks through those embassy gates in the final scene, the audience should feel he has truly chosen - not defaulted, not escaped, but chosen - who he wants to be.

**Screenplay Potential Score: 8/10** (after recommended revisions)
