## 1. Character Profile

### Basic Information

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Aaron David Mitchell |
| **Age** | 32 |
| **Nationality** | American (from Dayton, Ohio) |
| **Education** | Ohio State University, B.A. Political Science; Defense Language Institute (Korean, incomplete) |
| **Cover Identity** | Cultural attache, U.S. Information Service, Seoul office |
| **True Allegiance** | Freelance asset broker - sells intelligence to highest bidder (currently Mr. Kim's network) |
| **Years in Seoul** | 4 years (arrived 1989) |

### Physical Description

Aaron presents as non-threatening by design. He is:

- **Build:** Heavyset, soft around the middle - the physique of someone who sits at desks and eats convenience store ramyeon
- **Height:** 5'10" but carries himself smaller, shoulders often hunched
- **Face:** Round, forgettable features; thinning sandy-brown hair he combs over optimistically
- **Eyes:** Watery blue-gray, frequently blinking - reads as nervous but actually scanning
- **Dress:** Rumpled khakis, short-sleeve button-downs that strain slightly at the buttons, scuffed loafers - the uniform of a mid-level bureaucrat who stopped caring about promotions
- **Distinguishing marks:** Sweats visibly when stressed; unconsciously wipes palms on pants

### Defining Characteristics

1. **The Disarming Presence:** Aaron has mastered the art of seeming harmless. He laughs too easily, agrees too readily, and positions himself as the bumbling sidekick nobody takes seriously.

2. **Genuine Intelligence:** Behind the nervous exterior lies sharp analytical capability. Aaron speaks passable Korean (worse than Jake's), reads situations accurately, and never forgets a detail.

3. **Collector of Favors:** Aaron builds relationships through small kindnesses - a smuggled American candy bar, help with paperwork, a sympathetic ear. Each favor is an investment.

4. **Risk-Averse Operator:** Unlike Jake's action-hero instincts, Aaron avoids physical confrontation. He manipulates through information, misdirection, and plausible deniability.

5. **Self-Justifying Cynic:** Aaron has convinced himself that everyone is corrupt, so his own corruption is merely practical. He genuinely believes idealists like Jake are naive fools.

---

## 2. Psychology

### Want (Conscious Goal)
Aaron wants **financial security and an exit strategy**. He's accumulated enough to retire comfortably somewhere without extradition treaties. He needs one more big score - and Jake's network intelligence is that score.

### Need (Unconscious Requirement)
**None.** Aaron is a flat arc antagonist. He serves as a dark mirror to Jake - showing what happens when an operative abandons principle for pragmatism. His function is to illuminate Jake's choices, not to change himself.

### The Lie Aaron Tells
**"I'm just trying to survive like everyone else."**

Aaron presents himself as a fellow victim of the system - underpaid, underappreciated, stuck in a thankless posting while connected men advance. He frames his betrayals as survival, not greed.

To Jake specifically: *"We're in this together, buddy. Two Americans trying to make sense of this crazy place."*

### The Truth
Aaron chose his path. He wasn't forced into betrayal by circumstance - he saw an opportunity and took it. Unlike Jake, who was genuinely deceived, Aaron walked into his arrangement with Mr. Kim's network with open eyes.

He sells intelligence to whoever pays. His loyalty to Kim's network is transactional - if a better buyer appeared, he'd switch without hesitation.

### The Ghost (Backstory Wound)

**Cleveland, 1985:** Aaron's father, a factory foreman, was laid off after 23 years when the plant moved to Mexico. His father never recovered - died of a heart attack at 54, broken by a company that threw him away.

Aaron learned: *Loyalty is for suckers. Take what you can while you can.*

He joined the intelligence community believing in service, but the cynical culture, the bureaucratic indifference, and watching connected Ivy League types leapfrog him for promotions calcified his idealism into mercenary pragmatism.

**The pivotal moment:** Three years ago, Aaron passed low-level information to a Korean businessman for cash. Nothing classified. Just schedules, contact lists. When nothing happened, he escalated. Then Mr. Kim approached with a real offer.

## 3. Character Voice

### Speech Patterns

Aaron's dialogue should feel distinctly different from Jake's:

| Jake | Aaron |
|------|-------|
| Direct, economical | Rambling, self-deprecating |
| Confident silence | Nervous chatter to fill gaps |
| Action-oriented language | Passive constructions, hedging |
| Questions are demands | Questions deflect attention |

### Verbal Tics and Habits

- **Self-deprecation:** "I know I'm not exactly field agent material, but..."
- **Deflecting with humor:** Uses jokes to change subjects or ease tension
- **False solidarity:** "We Americans gotta stick together, right?"
- **Minimizing:** "It's probably nothing, but..." (when it's definitely something)
- **Trailing off:** Sentences that fade when he's hiding something: "I mean, I heard that Kim might be... anyway, forget it."

### What Aaron Talks About

- Complaints about the posting (food, weather, bureaucracy)
- Nostalgic Americana (sports, TV shows, missing "real" food)
- Office gossip and personalities
- Jake's skills and success (building Jake's ego)
- His own failures and limitations (building sympathy)

### What Aaron Avoids Talking About

- His actual work and responsibilities (vague about his role)
- Specific intelligence matters (deflects with "above my pay grade")
- His finances (lives modestly despite access to money)
- His past postings (gaps in his story)
- Direct questions about Mr. Kim or Korean contacts

### Sample Characteristic Dialogue

**Self-deprecation as cover:**
> "You're the real deal, Jake. Me? I push papers and try not to embarrass myself at diplomatic functions. Last week I called the Deputy Minister's wife by the wrong name. Twice."

**Deflecting with false incompetence:**
> "Korean still kicks my ass after four years. You pick it up in, what, six months? Some of us just don't have the gift, I guess."

**Building false intimacy:**
> "You know what I miss? Proper baseball. The Korean leagues are good, but it's not the same. You ever catch a game at Jamsil Stadium? We should go sometime. My treat."

**Nervous chatter hiding calculation:**
> "I heard something weird today. Probably nothing. You know how it is - half the stuff that comes through my desk is garbage. But there was this name - Kim something - came up in a context I didn't expect. You ever hear of a Mr. Kim? I mean, obviously that's like every third guy here, but this one felt... I don't know. Forget I mentioned it."

## 4. Arc Design

### Act One: The Trusted Friend

| Scene | Position | Function | Key Moments |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **3B** | After Jake's apartment routine | Introduction as fellow American, builds rapport | Aaron "happens" to be in Jake's neighborhood; offers to grab a beer; establishes himself as harmless, likable colleague |
| **6** | Director's office confrontation | Witness to Jake's skills | Aaron present when Jake handles the thugs; his "amazement" masks assessment of Jake's capabilities |
| **6A** | Private debrief after | Offers to help | Aaron volunteers to help Jake navigate fallout; positions himself as ally with useful connections |

**Act One Aaron Goal:** Establish trust. Present as the bumbling colleague who admires Jake's competence. Plant seeds for future "help."

### Act Two: The Helpful Colleague

| Scene | Position | Function | Key Moments |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **10A** | After Mr. Han meeting | Information gathering | Jake reports the Han meeting to Aaron; Aaron asks probing questions disguised as concern; feeds intel to Kim's network |
| **18A** | During Sung-ho planning | "Helps" with planning | Aaron offers equipment, contacts, advice - all designed to compromise the operation |
| **27A** | After document discovery | Deflection | Jake notices discrepancy; confronts Aaron; Aaron smoothly deflects with alternative explanation |
| **38A** | Mid Act Two | Betrayal setup | Jake discovers evidence that Aaron has been communicating with unknown parties |
| **49A** | Late Act Two | Confrontation | Jake confronts Aaron directly; Aaron reveals partial truth - admits selling information but claims he didn't know who was buying |

**Act Two Aaron Goal:** Extract maximum intelligence from Jake while maintaining cover. When suspicion rises, manage Jake's perception through partial truths.

### Act Three: Resolution

Aaron's fate in Act Three should serve the theme of identity and choice. Options:

**Option A - The Escape:** Aaron disappears before final confrontation, having already transmitted Jake's intelligence. He escapes consequences, representing the cynical survivor. Jake's final choice to walk into the embassy gains weight from knowing Aaron chose differently.

**Option B - The Exposure:** Aaron is caught in the embassy net. His capture validates Jake's choice to come clean. Brief scene where Aaron, in custody, sneers at Jake's idealism: "You think they'll thank you? You're a fool."

**Option C - The Consequence:** Aaron is eliminated by Kim's network as a loose end before the climax. His death shows the wages of cynical self-interest - he was never valued, only used.

**Recommended: Option A with element of C.** Aaron escapes, but we learn (through a brief moment) that Kim's network has marked him. He "won" but will spend his life looking over his shoulder. His freedom is a prison.

## 5. Integration Guidelines

### Relationship to Jake

**Surface Dynamic:** Big brother figure. Aaron is older (32 to Jake's 23), has been in Seoul longer, knows the ropes. He positions himself as mentor and protector.

**True Dynamic:** Predator and prey. Aaron recognized Jake's potential value the moment he arrived. Every kindness, every shared beer, every piece of advice was cultivation.

**Key Tension:** Aaron both envies and despises Jake. Jake has natural gifts Aaron lacks - fluency, physicality, genuine connection with Koreans. But Jake is also naive in ways Aaron finds pathetic. This contradiction fuels Aaron's ultimate betrayal.

**Dialogue guidance:**
- Aaron always agrees with Jake initially, then subtly redirects
- Aaron never directly criticizes Jake's choices - instead expresses "concern"
- Aaron's praise of Jake should feel slightly excessive, compensating
- When alone with Jake, Aaron's nervous energy should occasionally slip, revealing harder calculation beneath

### Relationship to Mr. Kim

**Do they know each other?** Not directly. Aaron deals with an intermediary - a Korean businessman who brokers information sales. Aaron has never met Mr. Kim face-to-face, which preserves deniability.

**Hidden connection:** Aaron may have unknowingly set up Jake's initial recruitment. The intelligence Aaron provided in early 1991 (before Jake arrived) helped Kim's network identify Jake as a potential asset. Aaron doesn't know this - revealing it could work as late-Act-Two revelation.

**Dialogue guidance:**
- Aaron should visibly react when Mr. Kim's name comes up (nervous, deflecting)
- If Jake describes Kim, Aaron's questions should seem supportive but actually gather intel
- Aaron's cover story should include skepticism about Kim: "That guy seems sketchy, Jake. You sure about him?"

### Relationship to Sung-ho

**Do they meet?** Ideally no, or only briefly. Sung-ho is Jake's authentic Korean relationship; Aaron is Jake's false American relationship. Keeping them separate maintains clear thematic contrast.

**If they must meet:**
- Sung-ho should immediately distrust Aaron (gut instinct)
- Aaron should be dismissive/condescending about Jake's "local friend"
- A brief scene where Sung-ho warns Jake about Aaron could plant seeds: "That American. His eyes don't match his smile."

### Key Scenes Where Aaron MUST Appear

1. **Scene 3B (Introduction):** Establish personality, build rapport, plant himself in Jake's life
2. **Scene 6/6A (Post-Thugs):** Witness Jake's capabilities, offer "help"
3. **Scene 10A (Post-Han):** Extract intelligence about Han's revelations
4. **Scene 27A (Discrepancy):** First real test - Jake suspects something, Aaron deflects
5. **Scene 49A (Confrontation):** Major scene - partial truth revealed, Aaron's mask slips

### Subtext Guide

| Aaron Says | Aaron Means |
|------------|-------------|
| "You can trust me, Jake." | "I need you to trust me." |
| "Be careful with these Koreans. You never know." | "Don't form connections I can't monitor." |
| "I've got a contact who might help." | "I have an asset I need to service." |
| "I don't know anything about that." | "I know exactly what that is." |
| "You're the real operative. I'm just a desk jockey." | "Underestimate me." |
| "We should stick together." | "Stay where I can watch you." |
| "I'm worried about you." | "You're becoming a liability." |

## 6. Sample Dialogue

### Line Building Trust (Scene 3B)

*Aaron spots Jake at a street food stall. Approaches with performative surprise.*

**AARON**
Jake! Hey! What are the odds? I was just thinking I'd grab something before heading back to my depressing apartment. You mind company? I know I'm not exactly thrilling conversation, but misery loves company, right?

*(waits for Jake to nod)*

Man, four years in Seoul and I still can't get used to eating alone. Back home, you eat alone, people think you're a serial killer. Here, nobody cares. It's liberating and depressing at the same time, you know?

---

### Line Deflecting Suspicion (Scene 27A)

*Jake has noticed a date discrepancy in the intelligence reports.*

**JAKE**
This report says the package was delivered March third. I was in the hospital March third.

**AARON**
*(wiping hands on pants, nervous laugh)*
March third? Let me think... Oh! That was the Yoo thing, right? Yeah, I remember hearing about a mix-up. The dates got scrambled in transmission - happens more than you'd think with the encryption protocols we use. Half the time I get cables dated from next week. I keep telling them the system's garbage, but you know how it is. Nobody listens to the guy from Ohio.

*(beat, watching Jake)*

Why? Is it important?

---

### Line with Dramatic Irony (Scene 10A)

*Jake tells Aaron about the meeting with Mr. Han. The audience knows Aaron will report this.*

**AARON**
*(leaning forward, concerned)*
Wait, slow down. This Han guy just... handed you a folder? With photos of Kim in a North Korean uniform?

*(shaking head)*

Jake, that's... I mean, that's huge. If it's real. But how do we know it's not disinformation? The North loves to plant stuff like this. Create distrust.

*(pause, carefully casual)*

What exactly did the folder contain? Like, specifically. I'm trying to think if any of it lines up with anything I've seen come through the office.

---

### Line When Mask Slips (Scene 38A)

*Jake has found evidence of Aaron's communications with unknown parties.*

**AARON**
*(caught, calculating quickly)*
Okay. Okay, look. Yes, I have contacts you don't know about. We all do, Jake. That's how this works.

*(harder now, different voice)*

You think you're the only one with a side operation? You think the Agency tells you everything? There are layers here you don't understand.

*(catching himself, softening again)*

I'm on your side. I've always been on your side. But I can't tell you everything. Not because I don't trust you. Because knowing would put you in danger.

---

### Line During Confrontation (Scene 49A)

*Jake has confirmed Aaron's betrayal. Direct confrontation.*

**JAKE**
How long?

**AARON**
*(no longer pretending, tired)*
Does it matter? Long enough.

**JAKE**
I trusted you.

**AARON**
*(bitter laugh)*
Yeah, you did. That's your problem, Jake. You trust too easily. You want to believe people are good. That the system works. That if you follow the rules, everything makes sense.

*(stepping closer)*

It doesn't. The Agency doesn't care about you. Kim doesn't care about you. The only person who should care about you is you. I learned that. You haven't.

*(beat)*

I'm not your enemy, Jake. I'm just not your friend.

---

### Line Revealing Philosophy (Scene 49A, continued)

**JAKE**
People died because of you. South Korean agents. Our side.

**AARON**
*(genuine flash of something - guilt? irritation?)*
Our side? There is no "our side." There's money and there's ideology, and ideology gets you killed.

*(quieter)*

You want to know the truth? I don't know who buys what I sell. I don't ask. It's cleaner that way. Maybe it goes North. Maybe it goes to some corporation. Maybe it goes into a file nobody ever reads.

*(shrug)*

I'm a middleman. Same as you. Except I get paid better.

## Appendix A: Aaron's Key Props

- **Worn briefcase:** Carries everywhere. Contains nothing classified - that's the point. It's a decoy.
- **American snacks:** Always has something to offer - a piece of gum, a candy bar. Small gifts that build obligation.
- **Reading glasses:** Doesn't need them. Uses them as a prop to seem bookish and harmless.
- **Wedding ring:** Wears one. No evidence of a wife. Unknown if real or another layer of cover.

## Appendix B: Aaron's Cover Weaknesses

Potential cracks in Aaron's facade that observant characters (or audiences) might notice:

1. His Korean is worse than he claims, but he understands more than he lets on
2. He lives modestly but occasionally lets slip knowledge of expensive things
3. His schedule has gaps he can't explain (meeting handlers)
4. He asks too many questions about specific operational details
5. When truly surprised, his nervous affect disappears briefly

---

## Appendix C: Thematic Function

Aaron serves the screenplay's central theme of **identity and choice** in three ways:

1. **Dark Mirror:** Aaron shows what Jake could become - an operative who abandons principle for survival. Jake's refusal to follow this path gains meaning through contrast.

2. **False Community:** Aaron represents the seductive lie of national/cultural solidarity. "We Americans" isn't real connection - it's manipulation. Jake's authentic friendship with Sung-ho (a Korean) is the real relationship.

3. **The Cynical Alternative:** Aaron's worldview - "everyone's corrupt, so why not me?" - is the philosophy Jake must reject. Walking into the embassy is Jake choosing truth over comfortable cynicism.
