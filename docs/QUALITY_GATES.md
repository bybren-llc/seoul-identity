## Escalation Protocol

### Level 1: Work Item Issue
**Trigger:** Single scene or element doesn't meet criteria
**Action:** Scene Writer revises, re-submits
**Escalation:** If 3 revision attempts fail, escalate to Level 2

### Level 2: Sequence Issue
**Trigger:** Multiple scenes in sequence have issues OR design problem
**Action:** Story Architect reviews, may revise work order
**Escalation:** If fundamental design flaw, escalate to Level 3

### Level 3: Structural Issue
**Trigger:** Gate failure OR fundamental structural problem discovered
**Action:** Story Architect invokes stop-the-line
**Resolution:** Return to Phase 1 for redesign if needed

### Stop-the-Line Authority

The Story Architect may halt all work when:
1. Any gate scores FAIL
2. Page count exceeds 120 or falls below 90
3. Aaron integration creates continuity problems
4. Mr. Kim arc doesn't resolve satisfactorily
5. Theme becomes obscured or heavy-handed
6. Pacing issues emerge that require structural revision
