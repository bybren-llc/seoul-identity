## 1. Character Profile

### Basic Information

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Unknown (addressed only as "Mr. Kim") |
| **Age** | 50s |
| **Nationality** | Korean (originally North Korean military intelligence) |
| **Background** | Former North Korean military intelligence officer; now operates as mercenary freelancer |
| **Cover Identity** | Presents as South Korean intelligence officer with parallel operation |
| **True Allegiance** | None - "serves the highest bidder"; currently contracted to Pyongyang |
| **Years Operating** | Decades; has been watching Jake since before he arrived in Seoul |

### Physical Description

Mr. Kim presents as authority incarnate - every element of his appearance designed to project control:

- **Build:** Lean, disciplined physique suggesting military background; moves with economy, never wastes motion
- **Height:** Average Korean male height, but carries himself with presence that makes him seem larger
- **Face:** Severe features, sharp angles; the face of someone who has made hard decisions and doesn't regret them
- **Eyes:** Cold, assessing - "Cold eyes assess Jake" is his introduction; his gaze weighs and measures
- **Hair:** Gray at temples, otherwise dark; meticulously groomed
- **Dress:** Conservative dark suits, nothing flashy; the uniform of institutional power across cultures
- **Distinguishing marks:** Perfect stillness when others fidget; a cold smile that never reaches his eyes; hands that stay visible and controlled
- **Vehicle:** Black sedan with tinted windows and professional driver - extension of his controlled presentation

### Defining Characteristics

1. **The Architect:** Mr. Kim doesn't just recruit assets - he designs them. Jake wasn't found; he was cultivated from college onward. Every belief Jake held, every mission he ran, every moment of pride was Kim's construction.

2. **Cold Assessment:** Kim's first instinct is to evaluate. He watches before acting, measures before speaking. His compliments ("impressive") are assessments, not warmth.

3. **Control Through Information:** Kim never uses physical force when information will suffice. He controls Jake through knowledge - what Jake believes, what Jake doesn't know, what Jake can't verify.

4. **Mercenary Pragmatism:** Unlike true believers, Kim has no ideology. He served North Korea because they paid well; he would serve anyone. This makes him more terrifying - he destroyed Jake's life for money, not conviction.

5. **The Teacher Who Unmakes:** Kim positions himself as mentor, protector, the one who "sees clearly." His offer to Jake - "I'll give you something new to believe in" - reveals his understanding of Jake's need for purpose. He created that need. He knows how to exploit it.

---

## 2. Psychology

### Want (Conscious Goal)
Mr. Kim wants **continued operation and extraction of value from his assets**. Jake represents years of investment - recruitment, cultivation, cover maintenance. Kim wants to either recover Jake as an asset or neutralize him as a threat to the network.

### Need (Unconscious Requirement)
**None.** Mr. Kim is a flat arc antagonist. He exists not to change but to illuminate Jake's choices. His function is to represent the path Jake could have taken - and must reject.

### The Lie Mr. Kim Tells
**"I'm offering clarity. I see you more clearly than you see yourself."**

Kim positions himself as the truth-teller, the one who can explain Jake's confusion. But Kim's "clarity" is another form of control - he wants Jake to accept Kim's definition of reality, Kim's explanation of identity.

To Jake specifically: *"The right question is 'who do I want to be.' And I can help you answer that."*

### The Truth
Mr. Kim is a predator who mistakes control for wisdom. He believes he "made" Jake because he manipulated Jake's beliefs and actions. But he's wrong about the essential thing: the parts of Jake that are real - the conscience, the care, the breaking - those weren't programmed.

Kim's claim that "even your conscience is my design" is his final attempt at control. It's also a lie. Tools don't break down crying. Weapons don't feel sick when they learn what they were used for. Jake's humanity proves Kim's limits.

### The Ghost (Backstory)

Mr. Kim's backstory is deliberately sparse - he's meant to be an archetype more than a history. But certain elements are implied:

**North Korean Military Intelligence:** Kim learned his trade in a system that treats people as resources. He rose by being useful, survived by being necessary, and eventually became what the system made him - a manager of human assets.

**The Turn:** At some point, Kim stopped believing in anything except transaction. Maybe he saw too much. Maybe he was betrayed himself. The result: a man who treats loyalty as a commodity and identity as a construction.

**Why He Chose Jake:** Jake was identified young - idealistic, talented with languages, hungry to matter. Kim saw malleable material. "Your idealism was perfect. You believed so completely."

## 3. Character Voice

### Speech Patterns

Mr. Kim's dialogue should feel like a controlled instrument - every word chosen, every pause calculated:

| Jake | Mr. Kim |
|------|---------|
| Direct when defensive | Indirect, circling, probing |
| Questions demand answers | Questions plant doubt |
| Emotional when pressed | Never emotional; emotion is weakness |
| Silence means uncertainty | Silence means assessment |
| Speaks to connect | Speaks to control |

### Verbal Tics and Habits

- **Perfect diction:** English spoken precisely, formally; the product of training
- **Measured pace:** Never rushes; lets pauses do work
- **Assessment language:** "Impressive." "Interesting." Compliments that are evaluations
- **Rhetorical questions:** "Did you never wonder...?" "Have you ever questioned...?"
- **False intimacy:** "May I call you Jake?" - requests permission to establish control
- **Cold smile:** Referenced repeatedly; his version of warmth is calculated

### What Mr. Kim Talks About

- Jake's potential and talents (building ego to control it)
- The complexity of the intelligence world ("no clean sides")
- Questions Jake should be asking
- His investment in Jake (framing manipulation as care)
- Identity as something assigned, not chosen

### What Mr. Kim Avoids Talking About

- His own background and history
- Who he actually works for (keeps this ambiguous until Act 3)
- Specific operations and their consequences
- Emotion, sentiment, anything that might suggest vulnerability
- Direct lies when half-truths suffice

### Sample Characteristic Dialogue

**Cold assessment at introduction:**
> "That was impressive, Mr. Cooper. Reckless. But impressive."

**Planting doubt:**
> "Your interests are serving your country. Though I wonder if you've ever questioned which country you're actually serving."

**False mentorship:**
> "I'm not here to expose you, Mr. Cooper. Quite the opposite. I'm here to offer clarity."

**The devastating reveal:**
> "I made you, Jake. Every belief, every mission, every moment of pride - I designed it. The CIA cover wasn't a cover. It was the lie I built you around."

**Final claim of ownership:**
> "The part of you that wants to do the right thing? The voice telling you to turn yourself in? I put that there too. Even your conscience is my design."

## 4. Arc Design

### Arc Type: Flat Antagonist

Mr. Kim does not transform. He serves as the fixed point against which Jake's transformation is measured. His presence asks: "If identity can be assigned, can it ever be authentic?"

### Act One: The Authority

| Scene | Position | Function | Key Moments |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **7** | Post-thugs | Introduction | Black sedan; "Someone who appreciates talent"; establishes power |
| **7A** | Sedan | Hook set | Plants doubt about Jake's handler; offers card with phone number |

**Act One Kim:** Mysterious, powerful, seemingly benevolent. He positions himself as the one who sees Jake clearly. The hook is set.

### Act Two: The Puppeteer (Mostly Absent)

| Scene | Position | Function | Key Moments |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **27** | Phone call | Pressure | "Questions are dangerous, Mr. Cooper" - shuts down Jake's inquiry |
| **33A** | Tea house | Test | Physical reappearance; assesses Jake's loyalty; delivers veiled threat |

**Act Two Kim:** Largely absent but felt. His network surrounds Jake. His doubt-planting from Act One grows into Jake's crisis. His reappearance in 33A reminds Jake (and audience) that Kim sees everything.

### Act Three: The Architect Revealed

| Scene | Position | Function | Key Moments |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **59** | Warehouse | All Is Lost | Emerges from shadows; delivers devastating truth; claims to have "made" Jake |
| **61B** | Embassy approach | High Tower | Intercepts Jake; offers return or threatens death; Jake rejects both |

**Act Three Kim:** Fully revealed as the architect of Jake's false life. His scene in the warehouse (59) is the emotional climax - not of Kim's arc (he doesn't have one) but of Jake's destruction. His scene at the embassy (61B) is where Jake completes his arc by rejecting Kim's claim to define him.

### Kim's Fate

**Left alive, neutralized by Jake's choice.**

Jake choosing the embassy destroys Kim's network more effectively than violence would. Kim survives but loses - his "masterpiece" walks away. His final moment should suggest either grudging respect ("Interesting") or operational retreat ("Pull the network. Seoul is burned").

---

## 5. Integration Guidelines

### Relationship to Jake

**Surface Dynamic:** Mentor and protégé. Kim positions himself as the wise handler who sees Jake's true potential, who can guide him through the complex world of intelligence.

**True Dynamic:** Creator and creation - or so Kim believes. Jake is Kim's "finest work," his "masterpiece," an identity designed from scratch. Kim's pride in Jake is the pride of an artist, not a friend.

**Key Tension:** Kim's claim that he made Jake - that even Jake's conscience is programmed - is the final battle. Jake must reject this claim not through argument but through choice. Walking into the embassy proves that Jake's agency is real.

**Dialogue guidance:**
- Kim should always seem slightly ahead of Jake, knowing things Jake doesn't
- Kim's warmth should feel calculated, his compliments like evaluations
- When Jake defies him, Kim should seem more curious than angry
- Kim's final lines should acknowledge something he didn't expect from Jake

### Relationship to Aaron

Mr. Kim is Aaron's handler. Aaron reports to Kim through intermediaries.

**Integration Notes:**
- Kim planted Aaron in Jake's life as another layer of observation
- In Scene 33A, Kim could reference "your American friend" to create unease
- Aaron's betrayal, when revealed, should connect back to Kim's network
- Kim's control extends even to Jake's friendships - nothing was accidental

### Relationship to Agent Park

Agent Park works for Kim's network. When Kim enters the warehouse in Scene 59, Agent Park is afraid of him.

**Integration Notes:**
- Agent Park is a subordinate, not a peer
- His fear of Kim establishes Kim's authority within the network
- Kim dismisses him ("Leave us") without hesitation

### Key Scenes Where Mr. Kim MUST Appear

1. **Scene 7 (Introduction):** Black sedan, cold assessment, the hook is set
2. **Scene 7A (Sedan):** Plants doubt about Jake's handler, offers card
3. **Scene 27 (Phone):** "Questions are dangerous" - shuts down inquiry
4. **Scene 33A (Tea House):** Physical reappearance, tests loyalty, veiled threat
5. **Scene 59 (Warehouse):** All Is Lost revelation - "I made you"
6. **Scene 61B (Embassy approach):** Final confrontation, offer and threat, Jake walks away

### Subtext Guide

| Mr. Kim Says | Mr. Kim Means |
|--------------|---------------|
| "I appreciate talent." | "I identify useful tools." |
| "I see you clearly." | "I understand how to control you." |
| "Questions are dangerous." | "Your independence threatens my operation." |
| "I've invested in you." | "You belong to me." |
| "I made you." | "Your identity is my property." |
| "Come back. I'll give you something to believe in." | "I can rebuild you as my asset." |
| "Interesting." | "You've surprised me. That's rare." |

## 6. Sample Dialogue

### Introduction - Cold Assessment (Scene 7)

*Jake approaches the black sedan. Window rolls down.*

**MR. KIM**
(in English, perfect diction)
That was impressive, Mr. Cooper. Reckless. But impressive.

**JAKE**
You've been following me. For weeks.

**MR. KIM**
(slight nod)
Months, actually. You're observant. That's good.

---

### Planting Doubt (Scene 7A)

*In the sedan. Jake guarded.*

**MR. KIM**
Tell me, Jake - may I call you Jake? - when did you last speak with your handler? Not the drops. Not the coded messages. An actual conversation.

*Jake opens his mouth. Closes it.*

**MR. KIM (CONT'D)**
You've never met him. Never heard his voice without filters. For all you know, your instructions come from a machine. Or from someone you've never considered.

---

### Pressure - Shutting Down Questions (Scene 27)

*Phone call. Jake has been asking questions.*

**MR. KIM (V.O.)**
Questions are dangerous, Mr. Cooper. Especially the wrong ones.
(beat)
Continue current operations. We'll discuss your concerns at the appropriate time.

---

### The Test (Scene 33A)

*Tea house. Mr. Kim already seated. Jake enters.*

**MR. KIM**
You seem distracted, Mr. Cooper. Unfocused. That concerns me.

**JAKE**
I'm fine.

**MR. KIM**
(cold smile)
Men who are fine don't wander through Itaewon at odd hours. Don't meet with strangers in coffee shops.
(beat)
I see everything, Jake. That's what keeps you alive.

---

### The Revelation (Scene 59)

*Warehouse. Kim emerges from shadows. Agent Park flees.*

**MR. KIM**
Hello, Jake. We need to talk about who you really are.

*Later, after the core revelation:*

**JAKE**
(barely a whisper)
Then who am I?

**MR. KIM**
(almost tender)
That's what I love about you. Even now, you think there's an answer.
(beat)
The teacher who cared about his students? I needed you to seem kind. The patriot who believed in his mission? I needed you to never question.
(leaning close)
I invented him. Every noble impulse, every moment you felt proud - I put it there. You're not Jake Cooper. You're a story I told.

---

### Final Confrontation (Scene 61B)

*Street near embassy. Kim intercepts Jake.*

**MR. KIM**
Come back. I'll give you a new identity. A new purpose. You know both sides now - that makes you invaluable.

**JAKE**
You mean it makes me a better tool.

**MR. KIM**
(shrugging)
Everyone uses everyone, Jake. At least I'm honest about it.

*Jake walks toward the embassy.*

**MR. KIM (CONT'D)**
(calling after)
I made you, Jake.

**JAKE**
(not turning back)
And I'm unmaking myself. Whatever comes next - that's mine.

*Kim watches him go.*

**MR. KIM**
(quiet, to himself)
Interesting.

## Appendix A: Mr. Kim's Key Props

- **Black sedan:** Extension of his controlled presentation; tinted windows, professional driver; appears in Scene 7 and Scene 61B (visual callback)
- **Business card:** Plain white, phone number only; represents the hook, the temptation, the door Jake eventually walks through
- **Tea cup:** In Scene 33A, Kim pours tea with ritual precision; control even in small gestures
- **Dark suit:** Conservative, institutional; no flash, no individuality; the uniform of power

## Appendix B: Mr. Kim's Weaknesses (As Antagonist)

Kim's apparent invulnerability has cracks that the screenplay exploits:

1. **Overconfidence:** He genuinely believes he "made" Jake - but Jake's humanity proves him wrong
2. **Lack of imagination:** He can't conceive of Jake choosing truth over survival
3. **Contempt for idealism:** He dismisses Jake's conscience as programming - but it's real
4. **Transactional worldview:** He thinks everyone can be bought or controlled; Jake's choice baffles him
5. **His final "Interesting":** A man who understood everything, surprised at last

## Appendix C: Thematic Function

Mr. Kim serves the screenplay's central theme of **identity and choice** in four ways:

1. **Assigned Identity:** Kim represents the opposite of choice. He assigns identity - to Jake, to his network, to everyone he controls. His worldview: "You are what others make you."

2. **Dark Mirror:** Kim shows what Jake could become - a man who sees identity as a tool, loyalty as a commodity, truth as irrelevant. By rejecting Kim, Jake rejects that possible self.

3. **The Architect Who Fails:** Kim's masterpiece walks away. His greatest creation refuses to be owned. This failure proves that even the most sophisticated manipulation cannot extinguish authentic selfhood.

4. **The Question He Can't Answer:** Kim can explain everything except Jake's final choice. "Interesting" is the response of someone encountering something genuinely new - a man who chose truth despite every programmed impulse to do otherwise.

## Appendix D: Comparison with Aaron (False Allies)

Both Kim and Aaron serve as false allies to Jake, but they function differently:

| Aspect | Mr. Kim | Aaron |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Presentation** | Authority figure, mentor | Peer, fellow American |
| **Method** | Direct control, philosophical manipulation | Friendship, casual extraction |
| **Knowledge** | Knows everything about Jake | Reports to Kim, limited view |
| **Motivation** | Professional, pragmatic | Financial, cynical |
| **Relationship to Jake** | Creator/creation | Predator/prey |
| **Thematic Function** | Assigned identity | False community |

Kim is the architect; Aaron is the tool. Both represent betrayals - but Kim's betrayal is total: he didn't just deceive Jake, he built Jake's entire self around a lie.
