## 1. Character Profile

### Basic Information

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Jake Cooper |
| **Age** | 23 |
| **Nationality** | American (from Cleveland, Ohio) |
| **Education** | College graduate; trained at "the Farm" (Langley) - though this training may have been manufactured |
| **Cover Identity** | English teacher at Korean Language School, Seoul |
| **Believed Identity** | CIA operative, deep cover, code name "Songbird" |
| **True Status** | Unwitting North Korean asset, manipulated since before arrival in Seoul |
| **Years in Seoul** | 2 years (arrived 1991) |

### Physical Description

Jake presents as approachable and unassuming by design - his cover depends on seeming like nothing more than an earnest young teacher:

- **Build:** Athletic but not intimidating - the physique of someone who stays fit through morning runs, not military training
- **Height:** Average American height, carries himself taller when teaching, smaller when surveilling
- **Face:** Open, friendly features that invite trust; eyes that betray intelligence when he forgets to mask it
- **Hair:** Brown, slightly longer than regulation - another layer of the "grad student" cover
- **Dress (Teacher):** Button-down shirts with sleeves rolled up, khakis, comfortable shoes - professional but approachable
- **Dress (Operative):** Dark jacket, black jeans, running shoes - the uniform of someone who might need to move fast
- **Distinguishing marks:** Hands that tap rhythmically when nervous; a habit of checking reflections in windows

### Defining Characteristics

1. **The Natural Chameleon:** Jake moves between identities with unsettling ease - warm teacher, cold operative, careful observer. The question the screenplay asks: which one is real? The answer: none of them, until he chooses.

2. **Genuine Connection:** Despite his double life, Jake's relationships with students are authentic. He stayed late to help a child learn to write. He earned Mrs. Park's deep respect. These moments weren't orders - they were choices.

3. **Trained Precision:** Jake sweeps his apartment for bugs, checks hair-traps on doors, positions himself with his back to walls. His tradecraft is excellent - ironically, taught by the people who deceived him.

4. **The Question Asker:** Jake's fatal flaw for an operative is his need to understand. He asks "why" when he should accept. This is what eventually unravels his false reality.

5. **Moral Core Under Pressure:** When thugs threaten his school, Jake intervenes despite the risk to his cover. When he learns he helped kill four agents, he breaks down completely. His conscience is real, even if Mr. Kim claims to have designed it.

## 2. Psychology

### Want (Conscious Goal)
Jake wants **to be a competent CIA operative, to serve his country, to matter**. He left Cleveland for purpose, not adventure. Every dead drop, every coded message, every risk - he believed it served something larger than himself.

### Need (Unconscious Requirement)
**To discover his authentic identity, to choose who he wants to be.** Jake has spent his entire adult life performing roles assigned by others - student, trainee, teacher, spy. He has never asked who Jake Cooper is when no one is watching. The screenplay forces him to answer.

### The Lie Jake Believes
**"I know who I am and who I work for."**

Jake's entire self-concept rests on his certainty about his mission. He is American. He serves the CIA. His sacrifices matter. When Mr. Han asks probing questions, when reports don't add up, Jake pushes down his doubts because the alternative is unbearable.

To himself: *"Two years. I gave them two years. This has to mean something."*

### The Truth
**Identity is a choice, not an assignment.**

The devastating revelation isn't just that Jake worked for the North - it's that his entire self was constructed by someone else. Mr. Kim claims credit for Jake's beliefs, values, even his conscience. But Mr. Kim is wrong about one thing: the teacher who stayed late with struggling students, the man who saved Sung-ho's sister, the operative who breaks down when he learns the truth - these weren't programmed. They were Jake.

The truth Jake must discover: he is not what was done to him. He is what he chooses to do next.

### The Ghost (Backstory Wound)

**Cleveland, Ohio - Growing Up Invisible:**

Jake grew up in a factory town where ambition was suspect and dreams were for other people. His father worked the line. His mother cleaned houses. Neither understood their son's restless intelligence, his need for something more.

Jake excelled at languages, at reading people, at becoming whoever he needed to be to fit in. He learned early that identity was performance - be the good student, the easy son, the kid who didn't cause trouble.

**The Recruitment:**

When mysterious men in suits approached him in college with talk of service and purpose, Jake felt seen for the first time. They told him he was special. Chosen. That his gifts could serve something greater.

He never questioned it. He was too hungry to belong.

**The Wound:**

Jake's ghost is invisibility. He spent his childhood being overlooked, underestimated, dismissed. The CIA offered visibility - a role, a purpose, a name (even if it was a code name). He clung to that identity because the alternative was returning to nothing.

When Mr. Kim tells Jake he was "chosen" and "cultivated," he's revealing that Jake's deepest wound was weaponized against him. His need to matter made him the perfect unwitting asset.

## 3. Character Voice

### Speech Patterns

Jake's dialogue shifts based on which identity he's performing:

| Context | Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Teaching** | Warm, patient, encouraging; uses humor to connect | "In America, nobody cares if your grammar is perfect. They care if you try." |
| **Operational** | Flat, precise, economical; stripped of personality | "Songbird confirms. Location Charlie, 2300." |
| **With Sung-ho** | Honest, vulnerable, occasionally raw | "I don't know how to live with this." |
| **With Mr. Kim** | Guarded, direct, hiding fear beneath defiance | "If this is a trap, you should know - I'll make it expensive." |
| **Internal/Alone** | Questioning, uncertain, searching | "Is any of this real?" |

### Verbal Tics and Habits

- **Self-questioning:** "Who are you?" - asked to his reflection, never answered
- **Deflecting praise:** Uncomfortable when Mrs. Park calls him special
- **Precision under pressure:** His language becomes more clipped when threatened
- **Code-switching:** Fluent Korean that surprises everyone who underestimates him
- **Trailing thoughts:** When he's processing betrayal: "I thought I was... I was never..."

### What Jake Talks About

- Teaching (with genuine enthusiasm)
- Purpose and meaning ("Money isn't everything")
- The mission (when in operative mode)
- His doubts (only with Sung-ho)
- Questions about identity (increasingly, as reality unravels)

### What Jake Avoids Talking About

- Cleveland, his family, his past
- How he was recruited (too painful, too foundational)
- His handler (has never actually met him)
- Whether he chose this life or was chosen for it
- The possibility that he's wrong about everything

### Sample Characteristic Dialogue

**Teaching mode - connecting with students:**
> "Sometimes the best opportunities are far from home."
>
> *(beat, choosing words carefully)*
>
> "Purpose. Feeling like what you do matters."

**Operative mode - cold precision:**
> "You've been following me. For weeks."
>
> *(statement, not question)*
>
> "Who are you?"

**With Sung-ho - raw honesty:**
> "Two years. I gave them two years."
>
> *(beat)*
>
> "I'm the fall guy, hyung. That's all I've ever been."

**After the revelation - shattered:**
> "I'm not here. I was never here. Jake Cooper doesn't exist."

## 4. Arc Design

### Act One: The Mask

| Scene | Position | Function | Key Moments |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **1** | Opening Image | Establish warmth | Jake as beloved teacher - patient, fluent, connected |
| **2** | Ordinary world | Deepen cover | Mrs. Park praises him; Teenage Boy asks why he came |
| **3** | Secret life | Establish duality | Apartment sweep, coded radio, hidden gun - the operative beneath |
| **3A** | Theme echo | Plant question | Rooftop: "Who do you want to be, Jake?" |
| **3B** | Aaron intro | False ally planted | Aaron establishes himself as fellow American |
| **4-6** | Catalyst | Skills exposed | Thugs at school; Jake fights, cover fractures |
| **7-7A** | Mr. Kim | Hook set | Recruitment into deeper operation; seeds of doubt planted |

**Act One Jake:** Confident in his masks, certain of his identity. Warm teacher by day, cold operative by night. The cracks haven't started yet.

### Act Two: The Cracks

| Scene | Position | Function | Key Moments |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **8-9** | Surveillance | Paranoia builds | Market tail, multiple followers, Aaron observed |
| **10** | Theme stated | Mr. Han | "The right question is 'who do I want to be'" |
| **14** | B Story begins | Sung-ho reunion | First authentic relationship established |
| **14A** | Flashback | History revealed | How Jake saved Sung-ho's sister, earned trust |
| **15-18** | Planning | Alliance forms | Jake and Sung-ho investigate together |
| **16** | Discovery | Evidence mounts | Photos of "targets" are innocent people |
| **27** | Midpoint | Identity fractures | Date discrepancies - "I wasn't even there" |
| **33A** | Mr. Kim pressure | Test of loyalty | Kim knows about Jake's questions |
| **30-33** | Han River | Physical journey | Crossing = transition from known to unknown |

**Act Two Jake:** Increasingly uncertain, questioning everything. His relationship with Sung-ho provides anchor as his professional identity collapses. The teacher and operative blur; neither feels real anymore.

### Act Three: Collapse and Choice

| Scene | Position | Function | Key Moments |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **59** | All Is Lost | Revelation | Mr. Kim delivers truth: Jake was North Korean asset since day one |
| **60** | Dark Night I | Physical collapse | Vomiting, shaking, unable to speak |
| **60-II** | Dark Night II | Sung-ho's story | The soldier who killed himself vs. facing truth |
| **60-III/IV** | Dark Night III/IV | Vigil | Hours of silence, names whispered in darkness |
| **60A** | Dark Night V | Choice begins | Jake alone, considering running |
| **61** | Break Into Three | Decision | Jake chooses embassy - chooses truth |
| **61B** | High Tower | Final confrontation | Mr. Kim intercepts; Jake rejects offer and threat |
| **64** | Final Image | Resolution | Walking into embassy - first truly authentic choice |

**Act Three Jake:** Completely shattered, then rebuilt through choice. The arc resolves not with victory but with decision: Jake chooses who he wants to be by choosing truth over comfortable lies.

### Arc Trajectory

```
MASKS ────────> CRACKS ────────> COLLAPSE ────────> CHOICE
  |               |                 |                 |
Teacher        Skills            "I was           "Whoever I
CIA Agent      revealed         working for       become - that's
Competent      Reports          the wrong        going to be
               don't match        side"          my choice"
```

## 5. Integration Guidelines

### Relationship to Mr. Kim

**Surface Dynamic:** Handler and asset. Mr. Kim presents as mentor, protector, the man who sees Jake's true potential.

**True Dynamic:** Creator and creation. Mr. Kim designed Jake's entire reality - his beliefs, his missions, his sense of purpose. Jake was never a partner; he was a tool.

**Key Tension:** When Jake learns the truth, he must confront the man who made him. The confrontation isn't about violence - it's about rejecting Kim's claim to ownership of Jake's identity.

**Dialogue guidance:**
- Jake should be guarded with Kim from the start - something feels off
- When Kim speaks truth wrapped in lies, Jake should almost believe it
- In confrontation, Jake's defiance should feel earned, not theatrical
- Jake's final rejection of Kim must be quiet, certain, devastating

### Relationship to Sung-ho

**Surface Dynamic:** Friends from a shared history. Sung-ho owes Jake for saving his sister; Jake owes Sung-ho for being real.

**True Dynamic:** Jake's only authentic relationship. Sung-ho is the B Story, the thematic guide, the voice that asks Jake what he chooses to be. Their friendship isn't transactional - it's the one thing in Jake's life that wasn't manufactured.

**Key Tension:** When Jake discovers the truth, he must face Sung-ho knowing he's been an unwitting enemy of everything Sung-ho values. Sung-ho's continued friendship - "you were lied to, same as me" - is Jake's lifeline.

**Dialogue guidance:**
- Jake is most honest with Sung-ho - no masks
- Sung-ho calls Jake "hyung" sometimes - brotherly intimacy
- Their silence is as important as their words
- Sung-ho's key line - "only real things can break" - should feel earned

### Relationship to Aaron (False Ally)

**Surface Dynamic:** Fellow Americans, casual friends, two expats navigating Seoul together.

**True Dynamic:** Aaron is a plant - working for Mr. Kim, cultivating Jake as an asset, extracting information through friendly conversation.

**Key Tension:** Aaron represents the "false community" of national solidarity. He says "we Americans" while betraying everything that means. Jake's authentic friendship with Sung-ho (a Korean) contrasts sharply with his false friendship with Aaron (an American).

**Dialogue guidance:**
- Aaron's questions should feel slightly too probing
- Jake's instincts should ping on Aaron early, even if he dismisses them
- When Aaron is revealed, Jake should feel stupid for trusting nationality over character

### Subtext Guide

| Jake Says | Jake Means |
|-----------|------------|
| "I teach English. That's all." | "Don't look closer." |

| "Sometimes the best opportunities are far from home." | "I ran from Cleveland." |

| "I'm not here. I was never here." | "Everything I believed was a lie." |
| "Whatever comes next - that's mine." | "I'm finally choosing for myself." |

## 6. Sample Dialogue

### Teaching Mode (Scene 1)

*Jake stands before his class, warm, patient, slightly playful.*

**JAKE**
(in perfect Korean; subtitled)
자, 여러분. 오늘은 길 묻는 연습을 해볼 거예요. 그런데 먼저--
*Okay, everyone. Today we practice asking directions. But first--*

He switches to English, gesturing dramatically.

**JAKE (CONT'D)**
Only English from now on. No Korean. Even if it hurts.

---

### Operative Mode (Scene 3)

*Jake's apartment. He picks up the radio receiver. His voice changes - flatter, more precise.*

**JAKE**
(flat, operational)
Songbird confirms. Location Charlie, 2300.

---

### Confronting Mr. Kim (Scene 7)

*In Mr. Kim's sedan. Jake guarded but curious.*

**JAKE**
I'm not getting in that car until I know what this is.

**MR. KIM**
My name is Kim. I represent certain... interests.

**JAKE**
My interests are teaching English.

**MR. KIM**
(amused)
Your interests are serving your country. Though I wonder if you've ever questioned which country you're actually serving.

---

### With Sung-ho - Raw Honesty (Scene 16)

*Jake paces. Evidence spread across the table. His world collapsing.*

**JAKE**
Two years. I gave them two years.

**SUNG-HO**
Gave who?

**JAKE**
(stopping)
I don't know anymore.

---

### After the Revelation (Scene 60)

*The alley. Jake broken. Sung-ho beside him.*

**JAKE**
(hollow laugh that's more like a sob)
I'm not here. I was never here. Jake Cooper doesn't exist.

**SUNG-HO**
You're sitting in an alley. I can see you. You exist.

**JAKE**
(turning to face him, eyes wild)
Everything I've done. Every mission. Every risk you took helping me. The people who died because of--

He can't finish.

---

### The Choice (Scene 61B)

*Mr. Kim has intercepted Jake. Final offer made. Final threat delivered.*

**JAKE**
You didn't make me. You just... pointed me in the wrong direction.

**MR. KIM**
I created your beliefs. Your values. Your--

**JAKE**
No. You exploited them. There's a difference.
(beat)
The part of me that wanted to do right? That was mine. You just lied about what right looked like.

## Appendix A: Jake's Key Props

- **Hidden gun:** In closet, clean and oiled. Jake hasn't fired it in six months. He reaches for it in Scene 3, then stops. The gun represents the operative he's becoming - or refusing to become.
- **Postcard from Ohio:** Cleveland skyline. He hasn't written home in months. His mother thinks he's building a career. The postcard represents the life he left and can never fully return to.
- **Mr. Kim's business card:** Plain white, phone number only. Jake pockets it despite himself. The card represents the hook that will destroy him.
- **Aaron's business card:** Kept, then discarded, then kept again. Jake's instincts war with his loneliness.
- **Photographs and maps:** The evidence of two years of work that might have been smoke the whole time.

## Appendix B: Jake's Weaknesses and Tells

Cracks in Jake's cover that observant characters might notice:

1. He moves like a soldier despite claiming to be just a teacher
2. His Korean is too good, too fast - more than a two-year posting explains
3. He checks reflections compulsively, positions himself with exits in view
4. When surprised, his warmth disappears and something harder shows through
5. He asks too many questions for someone who should just follow orders

## Appendix C: Thematic Function

Jake serves the screenplay's central theme of **identity and choice** in three ways:

1. **The Central Question:** Jake embodies "Who do I want to be?" His entire arc is the journey from assigned identity to chosen identity. He begins as a mask; he ends as a man making his first authentic choice.

2. **The Victim Who Chooses:** Unlike Mr. Kim (who chose cynicism) or Aaron (who chose betrayal), Jake was deceived. But the screenplay insists that victimhood doesn't exempt someone from choice. What Jake does after learning the truth defines him more than what was done to him.

3. **The Cost of Authenticity:** Jake's choice to walk into the embassy isn't victory - it's sacrifice. He'll spend years in interrogation rooms. His career is over. His name will be suspect forever. The screenplay argues that authenticity costs, and that the cost is worth paying.
