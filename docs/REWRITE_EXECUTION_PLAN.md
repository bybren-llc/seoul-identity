## Phase 1: Foundation Work (Pre-Scene Work)

### 1.1 Aaron Character Design
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Owner:** Story Architect + Dialogue Writer
**Deliverable:** AARON_CHARACTER_BIBLE.md

**Specifications:**
- **Role:** American operative, false ally to Jake
- **Age:** Early 30s (older, more experienced than Jake)
- **Want:** Career advancement, operational success
- **Need:** None (flat arc antagonist)
- **Lie:** Presents loyalty to Jake and CIA
- **Truth:** Working for competing interest (Russian? North Korean? Personal gain?)

**Arc Design:**
| Act | Function | Scenes |
|-----|----------|--------|
| One | Introduction as ally/mentor figure | NEW: 1A, 1B |
| Two | Deepens trust, provides operational support | NEW: 2A, 2B, 2C |
| Two (late) | Betrayal revealed or suspected | NEW: 2D |
| Three | Final confrontation | NEW: 3A |

**Integration Points:**
1. Scene 3-4 area: Aaron appears as "fellow American," builds rapport
2. Scene 14-18 area: Aaron "helps" with planning (actually feeding intel to handlers)
3. Scene 35-38 area: Aaron's betrayal discovered or suspected
4. Scene 55-58 area: Aaron confrontation before or after All Is Lost

### 1.2 Mr. Kim Arc Completion
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Owner:** Story Architect
**Deliverable:** MR_KIM_ARC_COMPLETION.md

**Current State:** Appears Scenes 5, 7 then vanishes

**Revised Arc:**
| Act | Function | Scenes |
|-----|----------|--------|
| One | Handler introduction (existing) | 5, 7 |
| Two | Periodic check-ins, increasing pressure | NEW: 2E, 2F |
| Two (late) | Revealed manipulation | Scene 45-area revision |
| Three | Final confrontation with Jake | NEW: 3B |

**Design Questions to Resolve:**
- Is Mr. Kim North Korean? Double agent? CIA who knows the truth?
- Does Mr. Kim deliver the All Is Lost revelation instead of Agent Park?
- Physical confrontation or psychological?
