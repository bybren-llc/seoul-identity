---

## Act One: Setup (Target: Pages 1-25)

### Opening Image (p. 1)
**Target Page:** 1
**Actual Scene:** Scene 1 (Lines 19-66)
**Description:** Jake Cooper teaching English at a Korean language school. Warm afternoon light, students laughing, Jake demonstrating natural warmth and cultural fluency. He speaks perfect Korean, jokes with students, embodies the ideal teacher.
**Thematic Setup:** Jake's masks begin here - the warm, competent teacher is already a constructed identity.

### Theme Stated (p. 5)
**Target Page:** 5
**Actual Scene:** Scene 10 (Lines 419-555) - Mr. Han at the cafe
**Spoken by:** Mr. Han
**Theme:** "Not 'who am I working for.' The right question is 'who do I want to be?'"
**Note:** This lands around page 18 in current draft - significantly late. Should be moved earlier or echoed sooner.

### Set-Up (pp. 1-10)
**Current Pages:** Scenes 1-3 (Lines 19-127)
**Elements:**
- [x] Protagonist's ordinary world - Teaching, apartment, dual life
- [x] Key relationships introduced - Students, Mrs. Park, hint of spy work
- [x] Flaw/need demonstrated - Jake's compartmentalized identity, unable to be authentic
- [ ] Stakes established - Stakes unclear until catalyst; need earlier tension

**Strengths:** Strong visual contrast between teacher Jake and spy Jake. Apartment scene (Scene 3) effectively shows his operational life.
**Weakness:** Setup feels rushed - we jump to catalyst too quickly without establishing Jake's routine or emotional stakes.

### Catalyst (p. 12)
**Target Page:** 12
**Actual Scene:** Scene 4 (Lines 129-163)
**Event:** Thugs attack the school, threatening Mr. Choi. Jake is forced to reveal combat skills no teacher should possess.
**Note:** Currently lands around page 4-5 - very early. This is a significant structural issue; the catalyst comes before we're fully invested in Jake's ordinary world.

### Debate (pp. 12-25)
**Current Pages:** Scenes 5-9 (Lines 165-412)
**Content:** After exposing his skills, Jake faces immediate consequences. Mr. Kim appears, reveals he's been watching. Jake is pulled into the night market world, followed, confronted on rooftops. The "debate" is whether to trust Mr. Kim.
**Weakness:** The debate sequence is compressed. Jake doesn't seriously consider alternatives - he simply gets swept into events.

### Break Into Two (p. 25)
**Target Page:** 25
**Actual Scene:** Scene 7 (Lines 264-308)
**Decision:** Jake gets into Mr. Kim's car after being blackmailed about his "extracurricular activities."
**Note:** Currently around page 9-10. Jake's choice feels forced rather than active. He has little agency in entering Act Two.

---

## Act Two: Confrontation (Target: Pages 25-85)

### B Story (p. 30)
**Target Page:** 30
**Actual Scene:** Scene 14 (Lines 705-739) - Reunion with Sung-ho
**Story:** Jake's friendship with Sung-ho. This relationship carries the theme of authentic connection vs. operational utility. Sung-ho sees Jake as a person, not an asset.
**Character:** Sung-ho (old friend, Korean, 40s)
**Note:** Currently around page 23. Well-placed relative to current structure, but could be introduced even earlier.

### Fun and Games (pp. 30-55)
**Current Pages:** Scenes 8-25 (Lines 309-1433)
**Content:** This is where the "promise of the premise" should deliver. We get:
- Night market surveillance
- Rooftop confrontation
- Cafe meeting with Mr. Han (exposition dump)
- Sewer chase sequences
- Warehouse confrontation
- Discovery of contradicting intel

**Strengths:** Strong action sequences (sewer, warehouse). Good spy craft moments.
**Weakness:** The "fun" is mostly reactive - Jake is chased, ambushed, given information. He rarely drives the action.

### Midpoint (p. 55)
**Target Page:** 55
**Actual Scene:** Scene 27 (Lines 1457-1528)
**Type:** False Defeat / Reversal
**Event:** Jake discovers date discrepancies in his operational reports. Missions he couldn't have run are attributed to him. The first crack in his understanding of his own identity.
**Quote:** "I wasn't even there. I was sick. Who..."
**Note:** Currently around page 48-50. Well-placed for current script length, but the revelation could hit harder.

### Bad Guys Close In (pp. 55-75)
**Current Pages:** Scenes 28-44 (Lines 1530-2198)
**Escalation:**
- Jake and Sung-ho meet at Han River, plan next moves
- They cross the river (strong visual metaphor)
- Reach safehouse, make plans
- Rooftop deal with unknown contact
- Receive equipment to contact real CIA
- Internal and external pressure mounts

**Strength:** The Han River crossing sequence is visually strong and thematically resonant.
**Weakness:** Many scenes feel repetitive (plan-move-plan-move). Stakes don't escalate enough.

### All Is Lost (p. 75)
**Target Page:** 75
**Actual Scene:** Scene 59 (Lines 2803-2877)
**Event:** Agent Park reveals the devastating truth: Jake has been a North Korean asset since day one. Every mission, every package delivered, helped Pyongyang. South Korean agents died because of him.
**Death Echo:** Jake's identity as a patriot, as a CIA agent, as someone who "mattered" - all dies.
**Quote:** "Who am I?"
**Note:** Currently around page 93 - significantly late. This needs to hit earlier.

### Dark Night of the Soul (pp. 75-85)
**Current Pages:** Scene 60 (Lines 2878-2957)
**Content:** Jake stumbles into the alley, broken. Sung-ho follows. Jake confesses he was "working for the wrong side. The whole time." Sung-ho offers the thematic antidote: "What's left is a man standing in an alley, deciding who he wants to be."
**Strength:** Strong emotional moment. Sung-ho's loyalty despite Jake's confession is powerful.
**Weakness:** Brief - could be extended for more emotional depth.

---

## Act Three: Resolution (Target: Pages 85-110)

### Break Into Three (p. 85)
**Target Page:** 85
**Actual Scene:** Scene 61 (Lines 2959-2991)
**Synthesis:** Jake calls the US Embassy. He makes the active choice to come in, to tell the truth, to face consequences.
**Quote:** "Okay. New game. New rules."
**Note:** Currently around page 97-98.

### Finale (pp. 85-110)
**Current Pages:** Scenes 61-64 (Lines 2959-3102)
**Content:**
- [x] Gathering the team - N/A (Jake acts alone)
- [x] Executing the plan - Jake walks to embassy
- [ ] High tower surprise - Missing
- [ ] Dig deep down - Minimal
- [x] Execute new plan - Jake chooses honesty

**Note:** The finale is heavily compressed. Most spy thrillers would have a final confrontation with Mr. Kim or another dramatic climax. Currently, Jake simply walks to the embassy.

### Final Image (p. 110)
**Target Page:** Last page (~55 currently)
**Actual Scene:** Scene 64 (Lines 3049-3102)
**Image:** Jake walks through embassy gates. Behind him, Seoul sprawls - "a city of millions going about their day." He walks inside. Door closes.
**Mirror of Opening:** Opening showed Jake as a teacher, performing for students. Final image shows Jake stripped of all masks, choosing authenticity over performance.
**V.O. Reflection:** "Whoever I become - that's going to be my choice."

## Structural Score: 5.5/10

### Strengths
1. Clear thematic through-line ("Who do I want to be?")
2. Strong opening/closing image symmetry
3. Effective midpoint reversal
4. B-story (Sung-ho) carries theme well
5. Authentic Korean setting details

### Critical Issues
1. **Pacing Imbalance:** Act One is compressed; Acts Two/Three are stretched
2. **Catalyst Too Early:** We don't know Jake well enough when crisis hits
3. **Theme Stated Too Late:** Core question comes at page 18, should be around page 5
4. **All Is Lost Too Late:** The revelation comes near the end, leaving little time for Dark Night and synthesis
5. **Underdeveloped Finale:** No climactic confrontation; Jake simply walks to embassy
6. **Missing Aaron:** Source materials mention Aaron (American false ally) - completely absent from screenplay
7. **Underutilized Antagonist:** Mr. Kim disappears after Act One; no final confrontation

---

## Notes for Story Architect

The current draft has strong bones but needs significant restructuring. Recommended approach:

1. **Expand Act One** (add 15-20 pages) to properly establish Jake's dual life before the catalyst
2. **Move theme earlier** - have Jake's mother ask "Do you know who you are?" in a flashback within the first 10 pages
3. **Add Aaron** as a false ally whose betrayal deepens the conspiracy
4. **Create Mr. Kim confrontation** in Act Three - the antagonist needs a final scene
5. **Deepen Dark Night** - extend Jake's emotional collapse before the embassy decision

The "All Is Lost" revelation is powerful but lands too late. Consider moving the revelation earlier (around page 75) to allow more time for Jake's transformation.
