## Mrs. Park

### Role and Function

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Mrs. Park (given name not established) |
| **Role** | Student / Witness |
| **Age** | 50s |
| **First Appearance** | Scene 1 (classroom) |
| **Function** | Establishes Jake's warmth as teacher; witnesses his skills |

### Physical Description

Older Korean woman, student in Jake's intermediate English class. Dresses modestly, carries herself with the dignity of a working-class ajumma. Bows deeply when grateful.

### Key Scenes

| Scene | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **1** | Class participant; Jake praises her pronunciation |
| **2** | Praises Jake to him directly; establishes his teaching reputation |
| **4** | Witnesses thugs at school; warns Jake they have guns |

### Voice Notes

- Speaks English with heavy accent (learning)
- Switches to Korean for emotional moments
- Formal respect for Jake: "Teacher" or "선생님"
- Sincere, warm, grateful

**Sample dialogue:**
> (Korean) 선생님 덕분이에요. 다른 선생님들은... 인내심이 없어요.
> *It's because of you, Teacher. The other teachers... they don't have patience.*
>
> (English, practicing) No. You are... special.

### Relationship to Jake

Mrs. Park represents what Jake's teaching genuinely means to people. Her respect for him is earned, not manufactured. When Jake intervenes with the thugs, she's the voice warning him of danger - and the witness to his true capabilities.

### Story Function

Mrs. Park humanizes Jake's cover. She's not a contact, asset, or target - she's a student who sees Jake as a good man. Her presence reminds the audience (and Jake) that his teaching identity has real value, regardless of its origin as cover.

## Mr. Choi

### Role and Function

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Mr. Choi (given name not established) |
| **Role** | School Director / Catalyst victim |
| **Age** | 60s |
| **First Appearance** | Scene 4 (referenced); Scene 6 (physical) |
| **Function** | His endangerment catalyzes Jake's cover fracture |

### Physical Description

School director, 60s. Blood on his lip from thug violence. Cowers behind his desk. The vulnerable authority figure who needs rescuing.

### Key Scenes

| Scene | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **4** | Mrs. Park reports thugs "have Mr. Choi" |
| **6** | Cowering behind desk; Jake rescues him from three thugs |

### Voice Notes

- Desperate when threatened
- Likely lies to police about how thugs were subdued (protecting Jake?)
- Authority figure in school context, helpless in crisis

**Sample dialogue:**
> (desperate) Please - I don't have it. Give me one more week--

### Relationship to Jake

Mr. Choi is Jake's employer in his cover identity. Jake's intervention saves him but also exposes Jake's capabilities. Mr. Choi owes Jake but likely doesn't understand who Jake really is.

### Story Function

Mr. Choi is the catalyst. His crisis forces Jake to reveal skills that a teacher shouldn't have, fracturing his cover and setting the plot in motion. He's a plot device more than a character - the endangered innocent who draws out the hero.

## Mr. Han

### Role and Function

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Mr. Han (given name not established) |
| **Role** | Contact / Theme-Stater |
| **Age** | 50s |
| **First Appearance** | Scene 10 (Cafe) |
| **Function** | Delivers theme statement and crucial exposition |

### Physical Description

Korean man, 50s. Sits with perfect stillness - the posture of someone who once wore uniforms. Weathered face, sharp eyes. Simple clothes that belie his significance. Drinks tea, waits before speaking.

### Key Scenes

| Scene | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **10** | Cafe meeting with Jake; delivers exposition about Mr. Kim; poses thematic question |

### Voice Notes

- Enigmatic, philosophical
- Speaks in questions that plant doubt
- Economy of words - lets silence work
- Presents as oracle/wise man archetype

**Sample dialogue:**
> "Mr. Kim works for the people who pay him most. Today, that is Pyongyang. Tomorrow, who knows?"
>
> "The right question is not 'who am I working for.' The right question is 'who do I want to be.'"

### Relationship to Jake

Mr. Han appears once, delivers crucial information and the thematic question, then disappears. His allegiance is unclear - he could be warning Jake, testing Jake, or serving his own agenda. What matters is the truth he speaks and the question he poses.

### Story Function

Mr. Han is the voice of theme. His question - "Who do I want to be?" - is the question Jake will spend the entire screenplay answering. He's less a character than an oracle, appearing at the precise moment to plant the seed that will eventually save Jake.

### Unresolved Questions

- Who does Mr. Han work for?
- Why does he help Jake?
- Does he appear again or is he a one-scene character?
- Is his information reliable or partially disinformation?

**Note for development:** Mr. Han's arc score in CHARACTER_ARCS.md is 3/10, noted as "exposition device rather than character." If expanded, he needs motivation and stakes beyond information delivery.

## Agent Park

### Role and Function

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Agent Park (given name not established) |
| **Role** | Pursuer / Network operative |
| **Age** | Not specified (implied 30s-40s) |
| **First Appearance** | Scene 59 (Warehouse) |
| **Function** | Captured by Jake; Mr. Kim's subordinate |

### Physical Description

Blood on teeth after capture. Laughs despite being caught. His demeanor changes to fear when Mr. Kim arrives - he's afraid of his own boss.

### Key Scenes

| Scene | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **59** | Captured in warehouse; begins to reveal information; dismissed by Mr. Kim |

### Voice Notes

- Mocking when caught: "You still don't understand, do you?"
- Speaks both Korean and English
- Fear replaces mockery when Mr. Kim appears
- Subordinate voice - follows orders instantly

**Sample dialogue:**
> "Your Korean is better than mine. But okay, Mr. Cooper. English it is."
>
> "You want to know who sent us? Everyone did. That's the joke."

*(Mr. Kim enters)*

> (to Kim, fearful) "Sir, he's--"

### Relationship to Jake

Agent Park is pursuing Jake but is revealed to be merely a tool - when Mr. Kim arrives, Park's power evaporates. His fear of Kim establishes Kim's authority within the network.

### Story Function

Agent Park serves two purposes:
1. **Tension builder:** His pursuit creates Act Three urgency
2. **Kim's entrance:** His fear when Kim appears establishes Kim's dominance

He's a setup for the real antagonist's entrance. His line "Everyone did. That's the joke" hints at the conspiracy before Kim delivers the full truth.

## The Old Woman (Tteokbokki Vendor)

### Role and Function

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Not established |
| **Role** | Contact / Dead drop operative |
| **Age** | 70s |
| **First Appearance** | Scene 8 (Seoul Market) |
| **Function** | Delivers intelligence to Jake; warns of surveillance |

### Physical Description

Elderly Korean woman running a tteokbokki stall at Namdaemun night market. Positioned at intersection of three alleys - good sightlines. Stirs bubbling red sauce. Speaks without looking up.

### Key Scenes

| Scene | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **8** | Passes intelligence to Jake disguised as food transaction; warns of two tails |

### Voice Notes

- Gruff, no-nonsense ajumma voice
- Speaks Korean mostly, broken English for show
- Coded communication through casual conversation
- "If you live that long" - gallows humor

**Sample dialogue:**
> (Korean) 왜 이렇게 피곤해 보여? 잠을 못 잤어?
> *Why you look so tired? Not sleeping?*
>
> (quieter, barely moving lips) Some heat you don't survive.
>
> (normal voice) Same time next week?
>
> (already serving another customer) If you live that long.

### Relationship to Jake

Professional contact. She's part of the network Jake believes is CIA. Their exchange is practiced, invisible to observers. Her warning about the tails shows she's protecting him - or protecting the operation.

### Story Function

The Old Woman establishes Jake's tradecraft world - dead drops, coded exchanges, surveillance detection. She's a glimpse into the operational life Jake has been living. Whether she's CIA or Kim's network is ambiguous, adding to Jake's eventual uncertainty.

## Unknown Man (Rooftop)

### Role and Function

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Not established |
| **Role** | Surveillance / Test |
| **Age** | 40s |
| **First Appearance** | Scene 9 (Rooftop) |
| **Function** | Confronts Jake; unclear allegiance |

### Physical Description

Hard face, dressed in black. One hand inside jacket (weapon or document). Weight on front foot - presenting, not attacking. Breathing steady.

### Key Scenes

| Scene | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **9** | Approaches Jake on rooftop after market tail; scene cuts before resolution |

### Voice Notes

- Thick Korean accent
- Direct challenge: "You're observant. For a teacher."

### Relationship to Jake

Unclear. Is he Kim's network testing Jake? South Korean intelligence investigating? The ambiguity adds to Jake's paranoia about who is watching and why.

### Story Function

Ratchets tension. Jake is being watched from multiple directions. The Unknown Man represents the closing walls around Jake's carefully maintained cover.

## Aaron Mitchell

### Reference Note

Aaron Mitchell has a full character bible: `AARON_CHARACTER_BIBLE.md`

**Quick Reference:**

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Role** | False Ally / Antagonist |
| **Age** | 32 |
| **Cover** | Cultural attache, U.S. Information Service |
| **True Role** | Freelance asset broker; reports to Mr. Kim's network |
| **Function** | Dark mirror to Jake; represents false community of nationality |

**Key Relationship:** Aaron uses "we Americans" to build false intimacy while extracting information. His betrayal is more personal than Kim's - he pretended to be a friend.

---

## Teenage Boy

### Role and Function

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Not established |
| **Role** | Student / Questioner |
| **Age** | Teens |

| **Function** | Asks probing questions that echo through the screenplay |

### Key Scenes

| Scene | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **1** | Notes Jake's Korean is "very good" |
| **2** | Asks why Jake came to Korea; why not stay in America |

### Voice Notes

- Skeptical, probing
- Not satisfied with easy answers
- Final assessment: "선생님은 이상한 미국 사람이에요." (*You're a strange American, Teacher.*)

### Story Function

The Teenage Boy asks the questions Jake can't answer: Why are you here? Why not somewhere easier? His skepticism foreshadows the questions that will eventually unravel Jake's certainty.

## Continuity Notes

### Consistent Elements to Track

1. **Mrs. Park:** Always addresses Jake as "Teacher" or "선생님"; her grandson is the Teenage Boy
2. **Mr. Choi:** Blood on lip after thugs; likely lies to police about rescue
3. **Mr. Han:** Perfect stillness; weathered face; speaks in questions
4. **Agent Park:** Fear of Mr. Kim; blood on teeth; mocking until Kim arrives
5. **Old Woman:** Tteokbokki vendor; positioned at three-alley intersection; coded exchanges through food sales

### Unresolved Character Questions

- **Mr. Han:** Who does he work for? Why help Jake?
- **Old Woman:** Is she CIA or Kim's network?
- **Unknown Man:** Resolution of rooftop confrontation?
- **Mrs. Park:** Does she appear again after Scene 4?
- **Mr. Choi:** Does his rescue have consequences?
