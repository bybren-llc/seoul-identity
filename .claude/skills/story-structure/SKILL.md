ACT THREE (Resolution)  ≈ 25 pages (25%)
                       ≈ 110 pages total
```

### Act One: Setup (Pages 1-25)
**Goal:** Establish world, character, and conflict.

| Beat | Page | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Opening Image | 1 | Visual thesis, tone, world |
| Theme Stated | 5 | Theme spoken (often missed by protagonist) |
| Set-Up | 1-10 | Ordinary world, status quo |
| Catalyst | 12 | Inciting incident, life disrupted |
| Debate | 12-25 | Protagonist resists call to action |
| Break Into Two | 25 | Commitment to journey, no turning back |

### Act Two: Confrontation (Pages 25-85)
**Goal:** Escalating conflict, character tested.

| Beat | Page | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| B Story | 30 | Subplot begins (often carries theme) |
| Fun and Games | 30-55 | Promise of the premise delivered |
| Midpoint | 55 | False victory or false defeat, stakes raise |
| Bad Guys Close In | 55-75 | Obstacles intensify |
| All Is Lost | 75 | Lowest point, seems hopeless |
| Dark Night of the Soul | 75-85 | Reflection before final push |

### Act Three: Resolution (Pages 85-110)
**Goal:** Climax and resolution.

| Beat | Page | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Break Into Three | 85 | Solution found, synthesis of lessons |

## The Hero's Journey (12 Stages)

Christopher Vogler's adaptation of Joseph Campbell:

### Act One: Departure
1. **Ordinary World** - Hero's normal life
2. **Call to Adventure** - Problem or challenge appears
3. **Refusal of the Call** - Hero hesitates
4. **Meeting the Mentor** - Guidance received
5. **Crossing the Threshold** - Hero commits to journey

### Act Two: Initiation
6. **Tests, Allies, Enemies** - Hero is tested
7. **Approach to Inmost Cave** - Preparation for ordeal
8. **Ordeal** - Major crisis, death/rebirth
9. **Reward** - Hero gains something

### Act Three: Return
10. **The Road Back** - Return journey begins
11. **Resurrection** - Final test, transformation complete
12. **Return with Elixir** - Hero returns changed

## Sequence Method (8 Sequences)

### Structure
```
ACT ONE
  Sequence 1: Status Quo & Catalyst
  Sequence 2: Debate & Break Into Two

ACT TWO (First Half)
  Sequence 3: Fun and Games A
  Sequence 4: Fun and Games B → Midpoint

ACT TWO (Second Half)
  Sequence 5: Consequences
  Sequence 6: All Is Lost → Dark Night

ACT THREE
  Sequence 7: Break Into Three → Finale A
  Sequence 8: Finale B → Resolution
```

### Sequence Length
- Each sequence: ~12-15 pages
- Each sequence has its own mini-arc
- Sequences end on a turn or revelation

## Genre Considerations

### Action
- Midpoint is often big action set piece
- Faster pacing through Act Two
- Extended finale sequence

### Comedy
- Fun and Games section is critical
- Midpoint often a comic disaster
- Third act reconciliation

### Drama
- More time in Dark Night of the Soul
- Subtler beat placement
- Character-driven turns

### Horror
- Midpoint: Monster fully revealed
- All Is Lost: Final girl alone
- Finale: Confrontation and survival

### Thriller
- Midpoint: Major revelation
- Bad Guys Close In is literal
- Ticking clock in Act Three
