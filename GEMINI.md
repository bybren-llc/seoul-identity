This file provides guidance to Gemini CLI when working with this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a screenwriting project for "Seoul Identity" by Scott Graham. The screenplay is written in Fountain format (.fountain), a plain-text markup language for screenwriting.

This repository uses a **multi-agent screenwriting harness** adapted from the WTFB Safe Agentic Workflow methodology.

## Quick Start Commands

### Workflow
```
/start-scene [description]  - Begin scene work with context
/end-session               - Complete session, commit progress
/check-format              - Validate Fountain syntax
/check-continuity          - Check consistency across script
/new-branch [type] [desc]  - Create properly named branch
```

### Writing
```
/new-scene [location]      - Add formatted scene heading
/new-character [name]      - Add character with tracking
/format-dialogue [name]    - Format dialogue block
/add-transition [type]     - Insert transition
/add-note [content]        - Add writer's note
```

### Analysis
```
/page-count                - Current page estimate
/scene-list                - List all scenes
/analyze-structure         - Structure analysis
/analyze-character [name]  - Character arc analysis
```

### Export
```
/export-pdf                - Generate industry-standard PDF
/export-fdx                - Generate Final Draft XML
/export-html               - Generate HTML preview
/export-all                - Generate all formats
```

```

## Validation

Run validation before commits:
```bash
npm run validate        # Full validation
npm run lint:fountain   # Fountain syntax only
npm run lint:md         # Markdown lint only
npm run lint:spell      # Spell check only
```

## Git Workflow

See `docs/WORKFLOW.md` for complete documentation.

### Branch Taxonomy

| Type | Pattern | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| Protected | `main` | Production-ready drafts only |
| Scene | `scene/{slug}` | Single scene work |
| Revision | `revision/{type}` | Full-script passes |
| Character | `character/{name}` | Character-focused work |
| Structure | `structure/{change}` | Reorganization |
| Fix | `fix/{issue}` | Targeted fixes |
| Export | `export/{format}` | Export preparation |

### Commit Format

```
type(scope): description

Types: scene, dialogue, action, structure, revision, notes, format, docs, chore
```

### Definition of Done

All branches require:
- `/check-format` passes
- `/check-continuity` passes
- Spell check passes
- Self-review completed

## Operating Procedures

- **Branch Protection**: Do not push directly to main
- **Git Branch Reminder**: Create feature branch for new work
- **Commit Message Format**: Follow `type(scope): description`
- **Fountain Format**: Validate before committing
- **Post-Edit Validation**: Run `/check-format` after edits

## Key Principles

1. **Pattern Discovery First**: Check existing patterns before creating new approaches
2. **Continuity Tracking**: Maintain character, timeline, and prop consistency
3. **Format Validation**: Run `/check-format` before export
4. **Git Integration**: Commit at logical checkpoints
5. **Quality Gates**: Script Supervisor approval before delivery
