# Parking Lot - Seoul Identity

Cut dialogue, alternative scene versions, and lines to potentially use later.

## Wave 1 Alternatives (Dialogue Pass - December 2025)

### Scene 8 - Market (Version B - Internal V.O.)

```fountain
EXT. SEOUL MARKET - NIGHT

Jake weaves through the chaos. His eyes never rest - checking reflections in shop windows, counting exits, cataloging faces.

JAKE (V.O.)
Three rules for a night market. Keep moving. Never stop at the same stall twice. Trust no one selling watches.

He passes a WATCH VENDOR who calls out to him.

WATCH VENDOR
(in English, too eager)
American! Good price! Rolex, very real!

Jake doesn't break stride. But his jaw tightens.

JAKE (V.O.)
That's the fourth time I've seen that face tonight.

He ducks behind a steaming fish stall. Waits. Counts to ten.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Could be paranoia. Could be survival.

He emerges on a different path. The Watch Vendor is talking into something that isn't a watch.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
In Seoul, paranoia's the only thing keeping me alive.

He vanishes into the crowd.
```

**Why not used:** More internal/passive; selected version establishes Jake's network (the old woman contact) and adds visual threat

---

### Scene 9 - Rooftop (Version B - Physical Confrontation)

```fountain
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Jake stands on the edge of a rooftop, facing an UNKNOWN MAN dressed in black. Wind howls between them.

The Unknown Man's hand reaches into his jacket.

Jake moves first. Closes the distance. Grabs the man's wrist before he can draw.

JAKE
Wrong move.

They struggle. Jake twists. The man's PISTOL clatters across the concrete.

UNKNOWN MAN
(through gritted teeth)
I'm not here to kill you.

JAKE
Then why the gun?

UNKNOWN MAN
Protection. This city isn't safe for anyone.

Jake releases him. Steps back. Kicks the gun to the edge of the roof.

JAKE
Talk.

UNKNOWN MAN
(rubbing his wrist)
Someone wants to meet you. Someone who knows what you really are.

JAKE
And what's that?

UNKNOWN MAN
A man with two faces. Maybe more.

He reaches slowly into his other pocket. Produces a CARD.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
Tomorrow. The cafe on the card. Don't be late.

JAKE
Who sent you?

UNKNOWN MAN
A man who knows your future. And your past.

He backs toward the stairwell, leaving his gun behind.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
Bring the card. Leave your gun.

JAKE
I don't carry a gun.

UNKNOWN MAN
(small smile)
I know. That's why he trusts you.

He vanishes down the stairs.

Jake stands alone. Picks up the card. The gun. Looks at both.

He pockets the card. Kicks the gun off the roof.
```

**Why not used:** Already showed Jake's fighting skills in Scene 6; this scene should feel different - intellectual threat, mystery, card drop is more spy thriller than action

---

### Scene 10 - Cafe (Version B - Shorter/Cryptic)

```fountain
INT. SMALL CAFE - NIGHT

A dimly lit corner table. MR. HAN, Korean, 50s, sits across from Jake. Between them, a FOLDER.

MR. HAN
You came.

JAKE
Your messenger was persuasive.

MR. HAN
He was told to be.

Silence. Mr. Han slides the folder forward.

MR. HAN (CONT'D)
Open it.

JAKE
What's inside?

MR. HAN
Questions. The kind that keep men awake.

Jake doesn't move.

MR. HAN (CONT'D)
You're careful. Good. Careful men live longer. But there comes a time when caution becomes blindness.

JAKE
And you're here to open my eyes?

MR. HAN
(slight smile)
I'm here to offer you a choice. The folder does the rest.

Jake opens it. Flips through photographs, documents.

His face changes.

JAKE
Where did you get these?

MR. HAN
Does it matter?

JAKE
It matters to me.

MR. HAN
Then you're asking the wrong question.

He rises. Leaves money on the table.

MR. HAN (CONT'D)
The right question is not where. It's who. And why. And whether anything you believe is true.

He heads for the door.

JAKE
Wait. Who are you?

MR. HAN
(without turning)
A friend. Until I'm not.

He leaves.

Jake sits with the folder. The questions piling up.
```

**Why not used:** Key expository scene needs room to breathe; loses chess-game quality and Mr. Han's elder energy

---

### Scene 14 - Hallway (Version A - Terse)

```fountain
INT. SUNG-HO'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY

Jake knocks on a weathered apartment door. After a tense pause, SUNG-HO, Korean, 40s, opens it, startled.

SUNG-HO
(half-whisper)
Aigoo...

JAKE
I need your help.

SUNG-HO
(scanning the hallway behind Jake)
You're supposed to be dead.

JAKE
Not yet.

They share a brief, intense look. Sung-ho pulls Jake inside, closing the door behind them.
```

**Why not used:** Version B establishes history through "hyung" and "two years" more effectively

---

### Scene 15 - Apartment (Version A - Direct/Interrogative)

```fountain
INT. SUNG-HO'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jake and Sung-ho sit on the floor around a low table. SOJU bottles between them. Documents spread across the table.

Sung-ho pours two shots. Slides one to Jake.

SUNG-HO
Drink first. Then talk.

Jake downs it. Grimaces. The soju is cheap.

SUNG-HO (CONT'D)
Still can't handle it.

JAKE
Still tastes like paint thinner.

SUNG-HO
(pouring another)
So. Who wants you dead?

JAKE
I don't know yet. Maybe everyone.

SUNG-HO
That's not an answer.

JAKE
Three weeks ago, my handler stopped responding. Dead drops compromised. Then someone tried to grab me outside Yongsan.

SUNG-HO
Agency?

JAKE
I don't think so. The guys who came for me weren't American.

SUNG-HO
(leaning back)
KCIA?

JAKE
Maybe. Or someone else entirely.

Sung-ho studies Jake's face.

SUNG-HO
You look like hell.

JAKE
Haven't slept in four days.

SUNG-HO
(beat)
What do you need?

JAKE
Somewhere to think. Someone I can trust.
(looks at Sung-ho directly)
There's no one else.

Sung-ho holds the look. Then nods.

SUNG-HO
You saved my sister's life. That debt doesn't expire.

JAKE
That was a long time ago.

SUNG-HO
Koreans have long memories.
```

**Why not used:** Version B has Sung-ho recognizing Jake's "targets" as innocent civilians - stronger plant for betrayal revelation

---

### Scene 16 - Revelation (Version A - "Being Framed")

```fountain
INT. SUNG-HO'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Jake shuffles through papers frantically. Stops.

JAKE
Wait. Wait wait wait.

He holds up two documents side by side.

JAKE (CONT'D)
This report says I delivered a package to a contact at Seoul Station on February fifteenth.

SUNG-HO
So?

JAKE
So I was being surveilled that day. KCIA had me under watch - I had to abort my cover run and hide in a movie theater for three hours.

SUNG-HO
You remember the movie?

JAKE
(distracted)
Some romance thing. Terrible.

He pulls out another paper.

JAKE (CONT'D)
And this one - March third delivery. I was in the hospital.

SUNG-HO
You said that.

JAKE
Someone else was running my missions. Using my name. My drops.

Jake realizes something crucial. His expression shifts from confusion to shock. He slams his hand on the table.

JAKE (CONT'D)
I'm not being burned. I'm being framed.

Sung-ho flinches slightly.

SUNG-HO
(quiet)
For what?
```

**Why not used:** "Fall guy" realization (Version B) is more dramatically satisfying - suggests longer con

---

### Scene 17 - Map (Version A - Pure Tactical)

```fountain
INT. SUNG-HO'S APARTMENT - LATER

A large MAP spread across the floor. Jake and Sung-ho sit cross-legged, leaning over it.

JAKE
Kim's office is here. Financial district.

His finger traces a path.

JAKE (CONT'D)
Building has three entrances. Main lobby, service entrance, parking garage.

SUNG-HO
Guards?

JAKE
Two in the lobby. One at the garage gate. Service entrance - just cameras.

SUNG-HO
(making a note)
Camera schedule?

JAKE
Rotation every forty seconds. Blind spot here.
(tapping the map)
Between the dumpsters and the loading dock.

SUNG-HO
Tight window.

JAKE
It's all we have.
```

**Why not used:** Version B adds character depth ("I wasn't always a good man") and dark humor for relief

---

### Scene 18 - Farewell (Version A - Minimal)

```fountain
INT. SUNG-HO'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jake checks his BACKPACK, loading supplies. Sung-ho hands him a small, old-fashioned WALKIE-TALKIE.

JAKE
(examining it)
Where did you get this?

SUNG-HO
Military surplus. Works when phones don't.

JAKE
Range?

SUNG-HO
Two kilometers. Maybe three if the weather's good.

Jake kneels by his bag, organizing items quickly but meticulously. Sung-ho stands beside him.

JAKE
If this goes wrong--

SUNG-HO
It won't.

JAKE
If it does. My family doesn't know I'm here. They think I'm teaching in Japan.

SUNG-HO
(quiet)
I'll find a way to tell them.

Jake looks up and nods in appreciation.

JAKE
Sung-ho.

SUNG-HO
(cutting him off)
Don't. We're not doing that.

JAKE
Doing what?

SUNG-HO
The goodbye. The "in case I don't make it" speech. Americans love that. It's bad luck.

JAKE
(small smile)
Fine.

SUNG-HO
Go. Do the job. Come back.

JAKE
That's the plan.
```

**Why not used:** Version B has sister callback and "doesn't change who you are" - pays off later

---

### Scene 11-12 - Sewer (Version B - More Hostile)

```fountain
INT. SEWER SYSTEM - NIGHT

Jake climbs down into the sewer. His breathing labored.

A SOUND - metal scraping concrete - somewhere ahead.

Jake kills his light. Waits.

Nothing.

He moves forward in darkness, one hand on the slimy wall.

INT. SEWER INTERSECTION - NIGHT

A flashlight BLAZES into Jake's eyes.

PURSUER (O.S.)
Stop.

Jake raises an arm to block the light.

JAKE
Don't shoot.

PURSUER
(Korean-accented English)
You run well. For a teacher.

JAKE
I'm just a teacher.

The Pursuer LAUGHS. Cold.

PURSUER
The men at the language school. Three seconds. Professional disarm. That's not a teacher.

Jake says nothing.

PURSUER (CONT'D)
Here's what happens now. You answer questions. Or I leave you here and the rats find you in the spring.

JAKE
Questions about what?

PURSUER
About who you really work for. Because we both know it's not Langley.
```

**Why not used:** Reveals too much too early; Version A plants seeds of doubt more effectively

---

### Scene 13 - Street (Version B - Internal Only)

```fountain
EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY

Jake emerges from a manhole onto a busy street, blending with the crowd.

A GRANDMOTHER with a small CHILD nearly bumps into him. She apologizes in Korean.

Jake responds automatically - perfect Korean, warm smile.

She moves on. The smile dies.

JAKE (V.O.)
(internal)
Six months of cover. Teaching. Smiling. Being the good American.

He passes a NEWSSTAND.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
All of it could be nothing. The man in the sewer could be lying.

He keeps walking. Faster now.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
But he knew things. Things he shouldn't know.

Jake spots a reflection in a shop window. Checks for tails. Clear.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Midnight. The warehouse. I'll get answers.

He turns down an alley. Gone.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
One way or another.
```

**Why not used:** Too passive; Version A's phone call attempt creates dramatic irony

---

### Scene 19-20 - Warehouse (Version B - Shorter)

```fountain
INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Jake enters cautiously. The UNKNOWN MAN stands in a pool of moonlight, briefcase at his feet.

UNKNOWN MAN
(no greeting)
You came. Wasn't sure you would.

JAKE
Who are you?

UNKNOWN MAN
The man who's going to destroy everything you think you know.

He kicks the briefcase toward Jake.

UNKNOWN MAN (CONT'D)
Open it.

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Jake opens the briefcase. Photographs. Reports. Dead faces staring up at him.

JAKE
What is this?

UNKNOWN MAN
Your work. Your kills.

JAKE
I've never killed anyone.

UNKNOWN MAN
Not with a gun. But the information you gathered, the packages you delivered - they were coordinates. Safe houses. Identities.
```

**Why not used:** Pivotal information dump needs room to breathe; Version A has gradual revelation

---

### Scene 24-25 - Escape (Version B - More Internal)

```fountain
EXT. BACKSTREET - NIGHT

Jake emerges into relative safety. Leans against cold brick. Tries to breathe.

His hands are shaking. The briefcase feels heavier than it should.

JAKE (V.O.)
(internal)
Three men dead. Maybe the one who tried to help me too.

A GROUP OF YOUNG KOREANS passes, laughing. One glances at Jake - the disheveled foreigner. Keeps walking.

JAKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
All because I believed a lie.

Jake pushes off the wall. Forces one foot in front of the other.

EXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT

Jake crouches in shadow. Pulls the crumpled paper from his pocket.

He reads the note beneath:

"Come clean. It's the only way out."

Jake's jaw tightens.

JAKE
(out loud, bitter)
Come clean. Right.

He thinks of everything he's done. Every mission. Every package.

JAKE (V.O.)
How do you come clean when you're covered in other people's blood?

He folds the paper. Slides it into his pocket.

Then he opens the briefcase again. Looks at the dead faces in the photographs.

JAKE
(whispering to them)
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
```

**Why not used:** Save internal processing for Scene 27 (Midpoint); keep escape external

## Lines to Save

Good lines that didn't fit but might work elsewhere:

| Line | Character | Potential Scene |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| "In Seoul, paranoia's the only thing keeping me alive." | Jake V.O. | Could work in finale V.O. |
| "A friend. Until I'm not." | Mr. Han | Strong exit line - could reuse |
| "Koreans have long memories." | Sung-ho | Could fit elsewhere in film |
| "How do you come clean when you're covered in other people's blood?" | Jake V.O. | Powerful - maybe dark night? |
| "The goodbye. The 'in case I don't make it' speech. Americans love that. It's bad luck." | Sung-ho | Great line - find a home for it |

- All recommended versions selected for continuity and narrative flow
- Alternatives preserved here for future drafts
- "Fall guy" vs "framed" decision shapes Jake's psychology
